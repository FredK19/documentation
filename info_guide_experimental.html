<h1>Guide to Experimental Features</h1>
<article>
<h2>What is an experimental feature?</h2>


An experimental feature is one which is designated as "ready for testing with live data." 
Experimental features made available to customers to solicit feedback and perform testing with real world data.

<article>
<h2>How can I tell if a feature is experimental?</h2>

It will say experimental on the configuration page, or in the documentation.
If in doubt, ask Zoovy support.

<h2>Why you should avoid experimental features:</h2>


These are new features, basically uncharted waters. 
In many cases we have not trained our internal technical or sales staff.
The feature might not work correctly all the time, it might corrupt data in your store, 
it could even cause lost sales by confusing customers, 
or not closing listings correctly and to top it off it may go through periods where it's "Dead".

Dead periods are ones where we determine the application needs a substantial rewrite in order to be effective so we disable it.

<h2>Why does Zoovy release features as experimental?</h2>


By calling a a feature "experimental" it allows Zoovy to deploy a feature, solicit customer feedback, and work with live data. 
<br>
<br>
All features when they are first released go through an experimental phase. 
This allows us to audit the performance, and make essential tweaks to make the feature more robust, 
easier to support, and/or easier to use. Ultimately this impacts the quality of the Zoovy platform, 
by making sure our customers are able to directly participate in the development of new features. 
We will also denote a feature as experimental if:
<li> the feature may be removed (or set as a separate billing package) in the future
<li> functionality may change without regard for backward compatibility
<li> if additional features are planned which will affect how that feature interacts with the system. 

<br>


We have found that in all cases there is no substitute for working with live data, and soliciting feedback from customers who actually plan to use the application. 
We should mention that we don't release a feature as experimental if there is even a 1% chance it will cause serious harm to a merchants bottom line (those features never even get included). 
Simply put, here at Zoovy we haven't found a substitute for letting the person who will ultimately be using the tool - give feedback on the tool while it's being developed.

<h2>Why should I use experimental features?</h2>

The answer is simple, you should only participate with experimental features in situations where you believe the final release will have a dramatic impact on your bottom line (in terms of increased sales, or time saved). 
It is a calculated business decision each business owner needs to make - with that understanding and at no time will Zoovy mandate that you utilize an experimental feature to run your business. 
On the other hand by using a feature during its experimental stage you have the opportunity to be sure that your feedback will go directly into the product to improve it, and that the specific feature meets your needs . which will ultimately have a positive impact on the bottom line.

<h2>What type of support is offered on experimental features?</h2>

none, zippo, nada, ziltch. If something "blows up" you can put in a high priority ticket, but aside from that if an experimental feature isn't working right, please let us know and we'll fix it as soon as we can. If you can't live with that please don't use it. 

</article>
<article>
<h2>How long will a feature remain experimental?</h2>

The experimental status is removed when it's demonstrated (based on customer feedback) that a particular feature is useful, robust, and easy to use. 
Once Zoovy removes the experimental feature it means that we will provide backward compatibility forever, or at least until a suitable migration path with equivalent functionality can be tested and implemented.

<h2>I am confused - should I use an experimental feature?</h2>

If you're still confused after reading this, then the answer is .No. - experimental features aren't for you.
