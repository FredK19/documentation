ups/fedex interface don't send declared value to the carrier, 
declared value is sent to UPIC instead. 
Zoovy sends nightly transfer of packages to UPIC.

state of this relationship:  we're live, this is in ZID 7.020

ideal customer is doing: 75 to 100 parcels per day
at that level UPIC provides: 
Better packaging strategies.
Advising on packaging (to prevent damage)
Understanding of what the package should look like (to reduce theft).
It requires UPIC start to understand their claims before they can make suggestions.

**** WHO IS NOT A FIT *****
U-PIC does not take all clients. 
- High value (over $1500.00) shippers with low shipping volume (25 shipments
a day or less) is not a good fit.
High value items e.g.: Flat screen TV shippers, Diamond shippers, Perishable products, Furs

This will be discussed in the BPP Q2-2008 Quarterly meetings
It has not been formally announced yet (we're waiting on Joel)

[[SECTION]Concept Overview]

Why pay the high cost of carrier provided insurance? Ship with the carrier and insure with U-PIC at a 50% discount! Whether you ship hundreds of packages a day or want to insure that special package once a year, U-PIC has teamed up with Zoovy to create a program to meet your needs.

U-Pic provide substantial savings on insurance for shippers using UPS, USPS, FedEx, DHL and most other carriers.
