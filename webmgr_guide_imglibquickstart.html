The Zoovy Media Library provides an intelligent repository that allows you to easily upload new and manage existing images.

<h2>How do I upload a new image?</h2>

Images are uploaded through the media library tool.

Even though you can store your images in different folders, no two images can have the same filename.  Due to possible issues, each image must have a completely unique name that has not been previously used.  Some Potential issues for re-using image names:
<br>
<li>Incorrect image displayed on site
<li>Incorrect image displayed in syndications
<li>Blank image displayed on site or in syndication
<br>
Should you see any of the mentioned issues, please try to upload the image again from your local system using a new image name to the products displaying the issue.  Be sure to refresh any syndications or listings for changes to take effect.

<h2>What image formats are supported?</h2>
.gif, .jpg, and .png are the only three web standardized image formats we support. If you upload other formats such as TIFF or PSD as an example your image will become corrupt and may not work. The best format to use for graphics is PNG, or JPG.  PNG will be the largest so if you have a lot of images we recommend JPG. 

<br>

Please remember all image names must not have any space in between the words in the name. You must substitute the space with an underscore [ _ ] example: red_boat.jpg
If you upload any image that does not follow the guidelines above you will have image corruption.

<br>

If you upload an animated gif into your media library, only the first frame will be displayed.  Animated images must be loaded into the the Public or Private (not yet available) Libraries, and link the image as detailed in web doc:  <a class="linkdoc" href="#?doc=50278">Doc 50278</a>

<h2>The importance of Good Product Photographs</h2>
Product Imagery can not be overstated.  Attributes, specifications and a great description will only do so much.  At the end of the day, for most products, the customer wants to see a picture of the product.  Flattering your product with good imagery will help you sell more.

<aside class="hint">

<div>
<ol>
	<li>Always use plenty of light with as few shadows as possible</li>
	<li>Try to shoot on a plain background such as a white or black background</li>
	<li>Sometimes taking a picture of your product being used or consumed is actually better than taking a picture of the product by itself</li>
	<li>Try lots of different methods, keep records of what works and what doesn't to save yourself time later. </li>
</ol>

<h2>How do I know how long an image will take to download?</h2>
Zoovy will automatically adjust image size to optimize download times and provide the highest quality available. 
Each copy is called an instance and appears along with its download time in the image property edit. 
First browse to the image using the images folders in the upper middle of the screen, then click on the image. 
All available instances will be shown along with their size and download time.

<article>
<h2>URL for an image</h2>
You can obtain the URL for an image you have uploaded by going to Setup | Media Library and selecting the appropriate image then specifying the size and clicking on the "create URL". (Hint: you can modify the height and width by simply changing the values next to the H and W in the URL - don't worry, you'll see when you get there!)

<h2>The Zoovy Media Library</h2>
As you use the Zoovy Media Library, you may notice that Zoovy generates 'instances' of your images.  Instances are a cached copy of one of your pictures that has been generated at some point in the past.  The media library generates an instance of your image in a different size (75x75 for a thumbnail, 150x150 on the product page, etc) in various places throughout your store.  Having an instance of the image store on the servers means that it will load quicker for your customers, instead of it being generated on the fly every time it is needed.  When you are in the media library, you may notice a number after the filename.  For example: mypicture.jpg (5).  The (5) is for the number of instances of that image that exist.

<h2>How do I know how much disk space my images are using?</h2>
A summary of all disk space will appear on your monthly bill.
In addition using the disk space manager you can see how much each folder is using. 
</article>

<article>
<h2>How can I clean up disk space</h2>
You can reclaim disk space using the Orphan Image report by going to Utilities | Disk Space.

<br>

<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>
The orphan image report is intended for sites with less than 5,000 products / images. Sites with more images will need to request that support run the report manually (because it will time out) and then remove the images by hand.

<h2>How can I upload a lot of images at once?</h2>
You can upload large amounts of images by uploading a zip file to the media library.
<br>
Put your images into a Zip file, go to Setup > Media Library and select the folder you want them to go into, then use the file upload dialog in the upper right portion of the window.
<br>
Zoovy will upload the file, unzip it and place the images in that folder.
<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>
NOTE: There is a file size limit of 10 mb for the upload process.  If your
images total more than that in size, you will need to split them into
separate zip files.

</div>
</aside>


You can also use the Zoovy Warehouse Manager for Windows to upload thousands of images at a time.
<br>
You can also use the Import tools to associate large numbers of images with products.

<h2>Image Gotcha</h2>
When images are uploaded for the first time in Zoovy they are placed on a file server. They are then distributed between 5 image servers, when an image is requested. 

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
The request goes to the load balancer. The load balancer makes the request to the image servers. If this is the first time the request is made for the image, the image servers will make the request to the file server. Then the file server will then give the requested image to one of the 5 image servers. The image server will then give the image to the load balancer and thus your image will appear. This process is slow and thus can cause your page to load slower. The next time and the more often the image is requested it will be stored on the image server as cached. This will make loading the image quicker. 

</div>
</aside>


<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>
The caveat, if the image is deleted, it will be deleted from the file server. Because the image is stored as cache there isn't a way to ensure that the image isn't there unless you go to the static image URL and do a shift refresh. By doing a shift refresh, the image servers will make the request to the file server.
