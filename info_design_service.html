<h2>Audience</h2>

Zoovy offers an Express Design Services which is geared specifically for two primary audiences:

<br>

Startup Edition store owners who often lack the design expertise, have minimal budgets, and need an expedited service to generate sales as quickly as possible.
Zoovy One store owners who are building multiple specialty sites and do not want to dedicate the requisite time or resources towards building a custom tailored website for each domain.

<br>
 
The Zoovy Premium Design Service is geared towards site owners who know exactly what they want in a site, or who want control over the final product. Premium sites involve multiple back and forth iterations with a designer where the business owner and designer collaborate.  This is especially useful for site owners who already have custom work and the business owner feels compelled to dictate which aspects of the current design they wish to preserve or enhance.

<br>

Regardless of the service utilized Zoovy employs a large creative team that collectively has hundreds of years of experience; we are very good at what we do. Express Design services are useful when site owners aren't sure exactly what they want, may not have the background or experience in design, need a faster turn-around, or who would simply prefer to "let us handle it".

<h2>What is different?</h2>

There are number of differences between the Premium Design Service and the Express Design Service. We have attempted to provide a clear differentiated list:

<br> 

<li> Client Services: Express Design Projects are not assigned a dedicated designer, and are managed through the Client Services department.
<li> Express projects have no scope meetings, the design questionnaire (which is to be completed by the customer for express projects) is used to facilitate the design. 
<li> As part of the Express service Zoovy uses an internal multi-department, peer-review process before a design is returned to the client for approval, effectively "it's finalized". With premium, the merchant and our designer work hand-in-hand throughout the design process to get it right.

<li> Previews for each separate component of the express design will be given all at once.  Therefore, if the customer has purchased more than an express design and an express logo, the time frame on the project may be longer.  This time frame will be assessed at the beginning of the project.

<li>Express offers no revisions:  The customer is given the option to either “pass/fail” the entire design, rather than ask for specific changes which often require multiple back & forth iterations.  (Express Designs can always be upgraded to Premium Design services by paying the difference, or small changes can be done on an hourly basis).  Premium designs can go through several revisions.

<li>Customers are not provided with any of the original artwork, such as illustrator or photoshop files.

<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>
The statements in the express questionnaire are "guidelines".
Express projects do not have requirements which must be absolutely adhered to by the design team. The express design service gives our internal design team full discretion over the final design, effectively we build the website as if we were building it for ourselves. 

<br>

As such any changes, such as colors, click behaviors, aspect ratios, etcetera which are requested after the design is submitted for approval are billable, regardless if those changes were explicitly mentioned on the questionnaire or not.

<h2>Predesign Option:</h2>

If the client has their own design firm and can provide artwork in a Photoshop PSD file and the work can be treated as an express package. If clients require designer to designer meetings to discuss system capabilities or custom functionality then that must be done through the Premium Design Service.

<h2>Appendix B: Promotional Banner Designs</h2>
The express package comes with some promotional banners to populate your homepage and/or theme.  It is best if you provide us with the specials or featured items/categories so that we can tailor them to fit your needs.  If you don't provide this information, we'll use our best judgement.
<br>
Please provide the following information for up to 4 banners/graphics:
<br>
<li>  1. Text for the banner.  For instance, if this is a seasonal banner, you might say 'summer specials - click here for details'. If the banner is for a specific category or product, you should let us know if it's on sale or part of a promotion.</li>

<li>  2. What image should we use?  Upload the image in to your media library.  Click on that image and then click on the 'original image url' link.  Paste that link in to this doc. If the banner is for something generic, such as 'events' or 'contact us', no graphic is necessary (we'll provide one).</li>

<li> 3. The destination link for the banner (optional).  If your zoovy store is set up, or you have an existing store, send us the link for what page the banner is going to go to. That will help us get inspiration and content for the design.</li>
