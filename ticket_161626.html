<h2>Issue #161626: How can I edit my homepage, wrapper, or website HTML?</h2>

We want a dropdown on the homepage of our domain.com.

<br>

The dropdown will have a list of all the other websites we own. The customer can select any site from the dropdown and then they will be taken to that website.
How can this be achieved?
If not achievable then whats the alternative so that we can market all our websites on the home page.

<h2>Response</h2>
Hello,

There is no specific piece of Zoovy functionality that will accomplish this.  You'll need to code the select list manually.  Make sure you use the proper linking syntax so that your customers 'cart' travels with them and the shop between stores.

If you would like Zoovy to set this up for you, please provide a list of all the stores you would like the select list to display.  It will take approximately two hours of billable time to implement this.  Turnaround is normally about 10 days.

I believe it is $125/hr.  but this may change seasonally, it is best to contact either sales or the billing department.

Where can we code the select list. we have html &amp; javascript expertise. but where do we need to code.

<br>

Or is it possible to create a category called Our stores and make it the first category with a different color or a different effect which stands out, and then when some one clicks on that category we can display a list of our stores

Zoovy is a highly robust and complex content management platform. It is not a simple static website, you can't just go dropping in HTML and javascript anyplace and expect it to work. Even if you test it, you may create other (unforeseen) consequence with other browsers and/or when the content elements are used in other parts of the site.

<br> 

You need to have an understanding of session id's, how carts are tracked, how the content management system works, etc. before you proceed. 
This is not something we recommend you attempt yourself (at least the first time) without some type of assistance.    We generally don't recommend investing in training for companies who don't have a full time website developer on staff. 

<br>

If your developer breaks your website, and you or anybody on your staff submits a ticket (for something you broke) we will diagnose it, and if possible fix it. 
We will charge you $125/hr for all the time it took to diagnose it (usually the fixes take just a few minutes). 

<br>

I want to stress - what you're trying to do can have unforeseen consequences this is a *very* complex system.  We don't recommend attempting to program it yourself unless it is something you plan to do on a regular basis. Cutting and pasting javascript from other sites can lead to a lot of incompatibilities.  When buyers can't checkout - you will likely put in a ticket. 

<br>

Usually we figure on at least 10 hours of developer level support to train somebody on your staff on the internals of this product, depending on skill level this could easily be 40-60 hours.  We don't know how long it will take your developer to learn this, it really depends on them. If they don't have good english communication skills it could easily exceed 100 hours. 

<br>

We do not provide answers to developer questions via technical support - please refrain from asking them.  Turn around time on things that you break maybe very long - so don't break things.  Repeated occurrences can and may result in account suspension.

<br>

The ability to edit the wrapper and page layouts is in the Setup area under website templates. The documentation for the system is located at http://webdoc.zoovy.com
