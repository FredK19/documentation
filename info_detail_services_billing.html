[[TITLE]Zoovy Client Services / Technical Support &amp; Billing Policies]

[[TAG]BILLING POLICY=1000]
[[TAG]BILLING=1000]

[[STAFF]]
Attention Zoovy Staff - effective 7/9/08:
*** You must record your time, round up to the nearest 10 minutes.  ***
*** this is a quick reference, see the bottom of the document for explanations ***

Billing codes: 
 call=technical support - inbound call.   (will be decremented from monthly)
 help=technical support - electronic tickets.   (no charge to client)
 imp=implementation - any pre-arranged appointment. (will be decremented from monthly)
 doc=Webdoc Updates - any time spent updating a webdoc (no charge to client?)
 dev=development - programming.  ($150/hr. based on client/contract rate)
 gfx=graphic design - design.  ($80~$150/hr. based on client/contract rate) 
 ppm=project management.  (usually free w/project, but we want to keep record)
 mkt=marketing - any work except research/analysis 
 mra=mkt. research analysis - strategic planning or research 
 bsm=basic site maintenance - ensuring site has no errors that would exclude client from 
     marketing program 
 sop=system operations - system administrator ex: ssl hosting. 
 esop=emergency system operations - emergency recovery, stuff like that. 

 bug= This aspect of Technical Support is free
 geek=PC tune up, network diagnostics, network consulting. 
 work=data formatting, data entry, csv imports, other "non support" tasks. 
 nzps=non-zoovy problem solving (supporting non-zoovy applications)
         (See 'Zoovy Billing Codes' in the section below for current pricing)

 miss=missed appointment (bills for 50% imp time to customer, but tracks 100% to employee)
 sync=time spent synchronizing with other resources in the company. see billing faq.

bill format: "code/min; note" 
so for example to bill for 1hr implementation call you would write: 
"imp/60; updated shipping rules"

If you want to record your time, but make sure the client is not charged 
e.g. comp the time then lead with a asterisk (*) 
ex: "*imp/60; updated shipping rules"

To bill for more than one person at a time:
ex: *help/10; message; # @tech; imp/10; message
** Please remember that if you are billing for your own time but you need 
to split the time you spent between two bill codes, you will need to follow 
the same format above (essentially you will need to add @yourname after the #)

Project users: to bill to a *TASK* you can simply check one or more tasks
then drop down and select /bill/ in the drop-down and type in "minutes; comment" 
HINT: this will divide the minutes evenly across tasks. 

It is imperative that you document your time in order for us to have accurate
reports.  A report of your billable hours will be covered during a review!

[[/STAFF]]

[[SECTION]Technical Support Policy]

This document describes the various Zoovy client service policies.

[[/SECTION]]
[[SECTION]Phone Support]

Policies and procedures regarding phone support has been placed in it's own document. Please review:

[[LINKDOC]50641]<br>
<br>

An overview of the types of support provided and how they operate is provided here:
[[LINKDOC]50736]<br>

[[/SECTION]]

[[SECTION]Electronic Support]

Electronic support for Zoovy services is generally free depending on the nature of the ticket as well as your package type.  The message should be created through the online ticketing system, and adhere to specific criteria:

<ul> 
<li> When available tickets must include at least one example, OR specific click-by-click instructions to re-produce the problem.
<li> If an error message is provided it must be included in it's entirety, especially the error #.
<li> The customer must distinguish between how the technology became impaired. Specifically, was it ever operational (yes, no, not sure) or was it the result of a recent implementation.
<li> The nature of the request is not billable. (See below for more information on Extended Support / Professional Services)
<li> There are billing packages which do not include any free support - including Zoovy Basic, and Zoovy Startup. (All tickets are charged at our hourly rates)
</ul> 

Customers who want to avoid typing or have a hard time articulating more complex problems are encouraged to provide screen captures - for instructions on providing a screen shot and attaching it to a ticket please visit: 
[[LINKDOC]50709]


[[BREAK]]

Electronic Ticket statuses are:
<li> HIGH PRIORITY - immediately begins paging the support engineer on call.
<li> ESCALATED - 1 business day response (any open ticket can be escalated by an account manager).
<li> MEDIUM PRIORITY - used for most tickets, general questions and technical support response within 2 business days (with most being addressed within 6 business hours)
<li> LOW PRIORITY - non-bpp feature requests, typos, mostly stuff to take care of in our free time.

[[/SECTION]]


[[SECTION]Implementation Time]

[[HINT]]
Effective 11/11/08: All Implementation time is billed at $100/hr. 
[[/HINT]]

Implementation services are available via pre-scheduled, and same-day appointments. Certain types of tickets (e.g. How do I do xyz) are also billed as implementation time.

[[SUBSECTION]Implementation Credits for BPP]
BPP Clients receive an hour of implementation for every $100 in monthly service fees. In exchange BPP members are required to use implementation assistance in exchange for establishing any new services. The time accounts are created each month with the invoice and expire after 45 days (two billing cycles.)

[[/SUBSECTION]]

[[SUBSECTION]Other Considerations]
Implementation time is not billed as a professional service, it is billed towards your monthly minimum.  This means that as long as you will pay success fees in the following month, any implementation charges below the success fee would be waived. 


[[/SUBSECTION]]

[[SUBSECTION]Cancellations]

Online appointments can be canceled 1 business day before the appointment with no penalty.  Missed/same day canceled appointments will be charged at half rate for 15 minutes (the amount of time we will spend trying to connect with you).  

[[CAUTION]]
Clients who habitually miss appointments or habitually cancel on the day of the appointment will be warned, and then charged for the entire hour.  
[[/CAUTION]]

[[/SUBSECTION]]
[[/SECTION]]


[[SECTION]Extended Support / Professional Services]

[[HINT]]
Unlike other e-commerce providers our support team will avoid referring you to contact another vendors technical support (unless it plainly isn't our issue - e.g. "my water heater is broken").  We view your problem as our problem and we want to work towards a resolution. For supported partners we will routinely contact the partner on your behalf to open a ticket. Our employees are instructed to never "pass the buck", if you ask for our help, you should expect to receive it. 
[[/HINT]]

The following types of service are considered exceptions to our FREE support policy:

[[SUBSECTION]Billable - Configuration Assistance]
Any "How do I" question which requires us to perform an "in-depth investigation" of a stores configuration, and recommend changes to the configuration will be considered the same as implementation time. In general "How do I" questions are generally better suited for implementation assistance, not technical support.  Examples of these types of questions include: shipping rules, non-hosted domain/email issues, or data imports. 
[[/SUBSECTION]]

[[SUBSECTION]Billable - Assistance with 3rd party software applications]
Free electronic support does not cover third party software applications. Examples of  third party applications include: Quickbooks, Microsoft Outlook, or Excel. Assistance getting through firewalls, or troubleshooting ISP /connectivity issues for a client. 
[[/SUBSECTION]]

[[SUBSECTION]Billable - Assistance with 3rd party services]
Free electronic support does not cover configuration assistance with third party services, or situations where the error is occurring due to a configuration issue with a 3rd party.  

[[BREAK]]

Examples of third party services include: Authorize.net, Paypal, Google Checkout, eBay, Amazon, Google Base, Google Webmaster tools.  Assistance with these external services will be billed as "NZPS" Non-Zoovy Problem Solving.  
[[BREAK]]

For example basic Google Analytics installation would be covered by implementation, however tuning, recommendations and troubleshooting advanced scenarios is not. 
[[/SUBSECTION]]



[[SUBSECTION]Billable - Consulting]
Zoovy provides a series above and beyond "technical support" including implementation, graphic design, programming, seo/marketing, integration, or data/import export services. 
[[BREAK]]
Free electronic support does not refer to any of those services. 
Each of those services will be charged at their respective hourly billing rates.

[[BREAK]]

In order to expedite request processing - any ticket which we believe will result in less than 2 hours of billable time will be immediately assigned to an internal resource. If you are not sure if you will be charged please let us know in the ticket. 

[[/SUBSECTION]]


[[CAUTION]]
Customers who fail to provide examples will be asked for examples or "click by click" to reproduce an issue.  This is because tickets without examples require exponentially more resources to resolve since the tech must login to the client's account. If a client requests a callback in an electronic ticket, this will be viewed as either a 'Call' or 'Imp' type of ticket and will be subject to callback time. 

[[BREAK]]

If an example is not provided and Zoovy techs will attempt to reproduce the problem and the customer will be billed for a minimum of 1 hour of ticket-triage time regardless if the issue is related to a Zoovy bug or not - always include at least one example. (Simply saying "it happens all the time" is insufficient)
[[/CAUTION]]
[[/SECTION]]

[[SECTION]Desktop Support]
Zoovy's Desktop software will always be designed to operate properly on a default installation of a supported operating system, with all available security patches applied, along with any combination of supported applications (such as Quickbooks, or Endicia). 
[[BREAK]]
Any other incompatible software, or failure to patch systems, or apply patches in the correct order (as recommended by the vendor) which results in failure of the software will be treated as a billable service by Zoovy. 
[[/SECTION]]

[[SECTION]Emergency Support]

If you have an emergency, please use the high priority ticket feature at http://support.zoovy.com.

[[HINT]]
Zoovy also employs a 7/24/365 answering service.  You may call us at 877-966-8948 x 3 -- after business hours you may reach an operator. Simple inform them you have a website affecting emergency and would like to speak with a member of the operations team immediately. 
[[/HINT]]

[[CAUTION]]
When you begin to submit a High Priority ticket, you will see a warning notice.  If you are reporting a system outage, the fee will be refunded.<br><br>
[[/CAUTION]]

[[CAUTION]]

Please note: High priority tickets page every member of our operations team. 
They should be used for critical order processing issues ONLY, ideally ones affecting multiple customers. 


[[BREAK]]

Customers who submit high priority tickets for something which has never been operational or is labeled experimental, will lose their access.  Customers who have more than 3 "emergencies" in a one week period will lose their access.  First warning will be for 6 months, second occurrence will be indefinite.

[[/CAUTION]]



[[HINT]]
Remember: if you can't login, or create a support ticket and you have an emergency you can call 877-966-8948. Zoovy forwards any overflow or after hours calls to an answering service which has the ability to access all members of the Zoovy operations team in the event of an emergency.
[[/HINT]]


[[/SECTION]]


[[SECTION]Credit &amp; Refund Policy]

[[SUBSECTION]"The Buck Stops Here" Policy]

Issues with third-party systems are billed as "NZPS" (Non-Zoovy Problem Solving). This billing code is used sparingly, and only in cases when we believe it is clear that our staff is being asked to support defects/mistakes in another providers application.

[[BREAK]]

However if a support request is billed for NZPS (Non-Zoovy Problem Solving) and the issue is later determined to be the fault of the Zoovy platform/employee then Zoovy will extend a credit to your Zoovy account for 125% of the billable charge.  The credit will appear on the next months billing cycle.  

[[BREAK]]
At any time a merchant paying Final Value Fees (Success Fees) may request the billing department to rerun their past invoices.  Zoovy will go back and rerun a maximum of the prior six months invoices and provide a maximum credit per invoice of 10% of the invoiced amount.  If requested, Zoovy will provide the customer with the data from the invoices that have been rerun for their own review.  Please direct any questions or requests for this service to billing@zoovy.com.
[[HINT]]
Zoovy will only run each individual invoice once, so we advise waiting at least one or two months before requesting an invoice be rerun.
[[/HINT]]
[[/SUBSECTION]]

[[SUBSECTION]Credit Eligibility]
The following guidelines are used to determine the eligibility of credit requests:

<ol>
<li> How soon were we notified of the issue, versus how long we took to address/fix the issue.  Even if you cannot put in a ticket, the support policies are very clear - we provide around the clock 7/24 phone assistance for any emergency.

<li> Was our staff polite and courteous, did they take "reasonable" steps to troubleshoot the problem. Did the advice of our technicians make the problem worse, or was the problem caused by one of our employees. 

<li> If electronic tickets were submitted, were they submitted with enough detail to diagnose the issue, in a timely manner, and were they submitted with the correct priority as outlined above. 

<li> Were the issues due to a system update of ours, or were our system updates in response to changes from a marketplace/vendor that were beyond our control, or where the errors simply the fault of the merchant making changes without the assistance of our implementation team.

<li> Were sales really effected - we may verify merchants sales compared to previous months, or the same time last year(s) if that data is available.  

<li> Zoovy does not apply credits for items/issues beyond 90 days. In no case will a credit exceed 3 months billable fees. 

<li> Zoovy does not - under any circumstances - apply credits for marketplace listing fees (e.g. eBay fees).

<li> Zoovy does not provide credits for the difference between quoted and actual shipping fees. 

<li> Zoovy does not provide credits for the value of sales lost, rather for our portion of those sales. 

[[HINT]]
Zoovy is not an insurance provider, our insurance does not cover your business losses. We strongly encourage clients to review their business insurance policy, and to discuss a variety of "what-if" scenarios with your insurance provider when considering which coverage to purchase.  Most insurance providers do offer policies which cover a variety of business losses due to software. 
[[/HINT]]

[[BREAK]]
An example of a service that would be considered billable is as follows:  A merchant has two non-Zoovy related pieces of software installed on their machine which both function properly with Zoovy's software when used one at a time.

[[SECTION]Other Fees]

[[SUBSECTION]SSL Certificates]

Effective Feb 1st, 2009 hourly implementation fees will be applied to accounts purchasing an ssl certificate for any domain where dnsadmin@zoovy.com is not the designated technical contact for the domain. 

[[BREAK]]

These implementation fees are necessary to coordinate the tedious process of obtaining the approval and subsequent issued certificate from the contact.  This process could take between 15 minutes to several hours (depending on the customers ability to receive and forward an email).  Customers are routinely encouraged to transfer their domains to Zoovy for the highest level of compatibility.  If DNSADMIN@ZOOVY.COM is listed on the WHOIS for the domain - then there are no fees (beyond the actual cost of the SSL certificate or true business id). More information on SSL Certificates and fees:

[[LINKDOC]50970]

[[/SUBSECTION]]

[[SUBSECTION] Insufficient Fund Fee]

For any e-check payment that is returned due to ISF, Zoovy reserves the right to charge a fee of $25 and require the full payment of the invoiced amount within 48 hours.
