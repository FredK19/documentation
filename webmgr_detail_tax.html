<h1>Sales Tax</h1>




<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>

Zoovy makes it easy to calculate taxes for orders. 
You can calculate taxes based on the state, city, zip code, or even country  for the destination of an order.  Sales tax is automatically applied to the order,  and can easily be accessed via the detailed reporting features of the Zoovy Reports section.

<br>

Specific customer accounts may be associated with a Resale Tax ID (using the Wholesale feature bundle) and then those customers will not have tax applie dot their orders.

<h2>Operation</h2>

Click on the Setup tab and then Sales Tax.<br>
<br>
Sales tax is configured using tax tables, which can be created and managed using either the Rule Wizard or Expert Mode.(Both of these tools are explained later in this doc) <br>
Using either of these tools, a merchant can configure custom tax tables to indicate what taxes should be computed for sales to specific locations.<br>
<aside class="hint">
<h6> Which tax should be configured first?</h6>
<div>
The last tax percentage configured in any rule will be the final computed.  So the last tax configured should be the most acute.  For example, a rule should be configured State >> County >> City, as opposed to City >> County >> State.

</div>
</aside>
 
To determine which taxes need to be configured for your specific location, and the amount of each, contact the Board of Equalization in your state. 
While the state tax for each state is the same for everyone in the state, local taxes vary. 
Most businesses currently charge a flat rate for tax in the state, but in reality this is incorrect.  Several states now require sellers remit taxes per destination in the state - however the states do not provide a clear and easy way to do this.

<aside class="hint">
<h6>State Board of Equalization</h6>
<div>
To obtain the local number for your state's Board of Equalization, look in your phone book, or go online to one of the many search engines and type in "Board of Equalization."

</div>
</aside>


The rule for e-commerce is that you must charge sales tax for each state
that you have an employee or agent living in or working in. If everyone who
works for you lives in Oregon, then you do not have to charge any sales tax,
but if you hire someone who commutes from California everyday, then this
changes everything. You will have to now start charging sales tax to all
orders coming from California. So with this employee, working for you would
have to charge the California state tax of 6.5 %*. You are saying wait a
minute, California's tax is 7.75 %.  Well you are right in most cases but
this leads into the next thing you must configure in order to have your
sales tax done properly.  Local tax. 

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
If you have employees (not independent contractors) in other states you may have tax liabilities in those states.  Also in the event your IC's are determined by your state to be employees, you could end up owing retroactively. 

</div>
</aside>


<br>

The town where you live in does local Tax. Continuing with our example, most
local taxes with add up to 7.75% like everyone charges for sales tax in
California, but this is wrong in some cases county will have a higher or
lower rate for their local tax. Zoovy gives you the option of configuring,
your local taxes for the counties in your state. The best way to find out
about all the local taxes in your area is to call the Board of Equalization,
in your state. They will gladly help you charge the proper amount for the
your state and local tax.


<section>
<h3>State Tax</h3>
A state tax is the tax throughout the entire state.
</section>

<section>
<h3>Local Tax</h3>
A local tax in one area could be lower then the local tax in another area. 
To properly set local taxes you must determine the ZIP codes ranges for each county and the corresponding local tax rate. 
</section>

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
Unfortunately county boundaries do not align to zip codes. Therefore a single zip code may have multiple rates, this is what makes collecting taxes for a business extremely frustrating.

<h2>How do I know if my Product is taxable</h2>

As a rule, services are not taxable, but products are taxable. So if you can hold it, then it's probably taxable. 
There are plenty of exceptions to this rule (eg: food); you should always contact your local board of equalization, 
or your local business licensing bureau. 
To configure your tax preferences, you need to enter the "Sales Tax Calculation" information 
in the "Setup" area of the Zoovy website. Click on the "Setup" tab located in the upper menu bar 
of the Zoovy Merchant site and select the 'Sales Tax' link.

<h2>Do I charge tax on shipping?</h2>

At the time of writing this document: WA and NY businesses then the answer is always yes, that is because
services are taxable in WA and NY.
<br>
In most other states shipping and handling charges are taxable if the charges are associated
with the sale of taxable goods or service. Associated means "part of".<br>
<br>
For example, you sell a sofa to a customer for $500. You agree to
deliver the sofa and charge separate fee of $50 for delivery. Because
your sale of the sofa is taxable, your $50 delivery charge is also
taxable. You should collect sales tax on $550. 
<br>
In contrast, if you sold a similar sofa for $500 to another customer who
issues you a properly completed resale or exemption certificate, then
your sale and the delivery charge are exempt. If you deliver the sofa
for a fee of $50, the delivery charge is not taxable. You do not collect
sales tax on the $550. If you pay somebody else $50 to deliver the sofa,
then that is also not taxable since you are passing that cost through.
<br>
In most states separately stated charges for postage are not taxable 
when billed by the seller to a client if the cost of the postage was incurred by the seller
at the request of the client to distribute tangible personal property to
third party recipients designated by the seller's client. <br>
<br>
In laymen terms:  sales tax on shipping is not applicable when you pass along associated 
costs (or a reasonable approximation of those costs) to the client.<br>
<br>
Most accountants and tax attorneys agree that tax only applies when shipping is a source of profit to you, 
NOT it's a service charge you pay to a 3rd party company at the customers request. 
It all makes sense when you consider that they probably designed the tax on shipping rule so that 
sofa companies don't offer promotions like: "free sofa - just pay for shipping". <br>
<br>
If you really wanted to cover your bases then enable customer pickup as a shipping method, 
that way you are letting the customer choose to pick it up, or request you contract with a shipping provider.<br>
<br>
If you are an eBay seller who tries to make a few extra bucks on shipping, the chances are you are exposing yourself
to additional tax liabilities.<br>
<br>
For the record, we are not a tax lawyers, and the rules above are generalizations, and may be very different 
in your state. Contact your state board of equalization, or your friendly neighborhood accountant and/or 
tax attorney for more advice.<br>

<h2>Okay How do I charge tax on shipping?</h2>

You need to create a shipping rule which applies an additional percentage to the shipping charge. 
<br>
Please note: this amount will NOT appear in the sales tax reports, Zoovy does not have a good way to track
tax on shipping, you will need to reverse this number out yourself.
</article>


<article>
<h2>Why doesn't Zoovy include updated tax tables for each state?</h2>
Zoovy does not offer tax compliance. Our software will collect taxes as they are charged. We will endeavor to work with each 3rd party system to interchange those tax tables. Tax rates change often and several companies which offer solely tax compliance charge routinely charge substantially more than we do for our entire service. 
<br>

The issue with providing a single table is it puts our business in a position of liability if those tables are incorrect. 
If you wish to share your tax table in this webdoc, we will accept it.

<h2>Creating a Tax Table</h2>
<br>
The easier (especially for novice users) of the two Tax Table creation / Management tools is the Rule Wizard.<br>
<section>
<h3>Using the Rule Wizard</h3>
Click on the Rule Wizard Tab.<br>
From the drop down menu, select which type of Tax Rule you would like to add to the table. (remember that the most acute setting should be configured last).<br>
Configure the % of the tax to be computed, and any of the additional fields you would like taxed.<br>
Add Tax Rule<br>
<br>
Once Tax Rules have been created using the Rules Wizard, those rules can be manipulated and edited using Expert Mode.<br>
Any rules created using the Rule Wizard will automatically appear in the Expert Mode, which can then be edited by copying and pasting the contents into a program like Notepad.
<br>
Advanced users can also use the Expert Mode to create their Tax Rules.  This is only recommended for users that feel very comfortable with configuring and manipulating data in this format.
<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
The Zone section should be used to configure a hint which can be used to find the product attribute which will be associated to a tax rule.  For instance, a tax rule for New York, NY would look like this.  NY NY is what was configured in this rule for Zone.: <br>
City	New York, New York	8.750%	-	-	-	-	NY NY:

</div>
</aside>

<aside class="hint">

<div>
The Expiration Date setting is used to configure taxes that have an expiration date, such as taxes that end on certain dates, or upon completion of a specified government funded project.(Rarely used).

The tax tables displayed in this web doc are for reference purposes only.  As most have been created and shared by other Zoovy merchants, Zoovy cannot guarantee the accuracy of these tables.

<h2>Expert Mode</h2>
The Expert Mode is a text box that will allow you to enter data as comma separated values. Headers are not used, but it is extremely important that you configure the data in the correct order: Match Type, Match Value, Percentage, Also Applies, Zone, Expires.<br>
Here is an example of data:<br>
state,CA,7.250,30,SD,20110101
<br>
<b>Match Type</b><br>
The first item of data will be Match Type, this is shown as Rule Type in the rule wizard.  Here is the list of possible data options:
<li>state = Rule Type STATE:Code
<li>city = Rule Type LOCAL:State+city
<li>zipspan = Rule Type LOCAL:Zip Range
<li>zip4 = Rule Type LOCAL:Zip+4
<li>country = Rule Type STATE:Country
<li>intprovince = Rule Type LOCAL:Country+province
<li>intzip = Rule Type LOCAL:Country+zip
<br>
<b>Match Value</b><br>
This data should reflect the Match Type.  For example, if your are entering a State Tax Rate and you use the Match Type of State then the Match Value would be the two letter code for that state. <br>
<b>Percentage</b><br>
This is the percentage charged for the tax.  For example, if the tax rate is 7.25% then you would enter 7.25 here.<br>
<b>Also Applies</b><br>
This section is for the other things that you can tax like shipping and handling.  Each of the options has a numerical value assigned to it:<br>
<li>2 = charge tax on shipping
<li>4 = charge tax on handling
<li>8 = charge tax on insurance
<li>16 = charge tax on specialty fees<br>
In order to select the correct options you add the numbers together for what you want to select.  That sum will cause those options to be selected.  For example, if you wanted to charge tax on shipping and insurance then you would add 2 and 8 together to get 10.  Then enter 10 in the section for Also Applies.
<br>
<b>Zone</b><br>
This is where you enter the data to populate the Zone field.  This field is alphanumeric.
<br>
<b>Expires</b><br>
Enter the date that this rule will expire.  The format of this rule is important (YYYYMMDD).  So, if this rule expires on July 1, 2009 you would enter 20090701.
