<h2>Search Engine Optimization Tips</h2>

<li> Specialty site hosting</li>
<li> Google Sitemap</li>

<h3>Syndication</h3>
If you are not taking advantage of Zoovy's Syndication, you should. It is a tried and true way of getting business back to your online store and raise your search engine rankings.
</section>

<section>
<h3>Content</h3>
Nothing will help your search engine results more than actually having the content that users are looking for. It also helps to add new content on a regular basis - daily if you can.  Original articles and updates are a good source of organic content.  You should also use a product layout that supports reviews and make sure every product has at least one, even if you write it yourself (don't always score your products with a 10).
<br>
If you do write articles (as category pages) that mention specific products that you sell in your store, link to them from the article itself (using wiki, of course).  Good practice is to link a keyword one time for every four it appears on the content of the page.
</section>

<section>
<h3>Meta</h3>
Don't spend a lot of time entering keywords and meta descriptions, search engines don't use these nearly as much as they used to.  The meta description is used to display a brief synopsis of page content on the search results page (on google, for instance).

<section>
<h3>What are Meta Tags -- why are they important?</h3>

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
META tags aren't important, however a lot of old information still says they are.

</div>
</aside>


All major search engines look exclusively at the visible content of the page, the graphics
(including the alt tags of the graphics), the link popularity of a page, how many clicks from the root domain to get to the page, the name of the page,
how deep the page is in the website, and if the content is dynamic.
NONE of them look at the hidden meta tags anymore (in fact none have since
2001).<br>
<br>
<br>
A lot of outdated information will tell you about the merits of keywords.
All of the settings on this page -  ARE IGNORED BY EVERY MAJOR SEARCH ENGINE including Google, Altavista, MSN, and Inktomi/Yahoo. If you believe that configuring META tag settings will change your search engine position, you are wrong. <br>
<br>
With that in mind, Zoovy is focused to giving our customers the features that they want, and we are also big believers in the proven medical benefits of placebos.

</section>

<section>
<h3>Google Adwords</h3>
Many merchants seeking to raise their Search Engine Optimization use Google Adwords. While you do not manage your Adwords campaigns directly through Zoovy, you can use the Google Analytics tool on your Zoovy site to ensure that Adwords campaign are in fact generating revenue.<br>
If you have never used Adwords before, we suggest that you begin with the Starter Edition available at adwords.google.com<br>
Be sure to generate and paste in the Google Adwords Tracking code to keep tabs on the effectiveness of your Adwords campaigns. <br>
Google Adwords offers a Budget Optimizer to keep your CPC costs down. Note, the Budget Optimizer is incompatible with Ad Scheduling.

<div>If all else fails, try focusing on a specific "niche." Gear the content of your online store towards a particular brand, make or model. It is better to be at the top of search engine results for something than it is to be in the middle of search engine results for everything.
