The CSV Product Import is easy to use. Just export your data to a CSV file, then put the appropriate headings in the first row (called the Header).
Place one attribute in the following format in each column of the header to denote which field you will be saving. The import process is case sensitive.
<br>


[[CAUTION]]
** Always test your imports. Data recoveries are possible, but aren't free.  
If you aren't sure what you're doing ask support (an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure).<br><br>
** If you've never worked with CSVs before, please schedule an appointment with Implementation. (Support >> Implementation)

Example CSV File (as a spreadsheet):<br>
<table>

<td valign='top' nowrap bgcolor="EEEEEE">%PRODUCTID</td>
<td valign='top' nowrap bgcolor="EEEEEE">zoovy:prod_name</td>
<td valign='top' nowrap bgcolor="EEEEEE">zoovy:base_price</td>

<br>

<br>
The example above would create two products JELLYDO, and SPRINKLE, a name of Jelly Filled Doughnut, and Doughnut with Sprinkles on Top respectively and with a price of $1 each. The Images would be downloaded into the Zoovy Image library from the URL's specified, and saved as image libraries in the zoovy:prod_image1 (the product's primary image attribute).

[[SECTION]CSV Import Utility Configuration Options]


[[SUBSECTION]Do not encode categories]

Normally you can import categories with "pretty names" such as /level1/level2. Each category internally also has what is called a "safe name". If you want to upload categories such as "1/2 lots" or "tcp/ip books" then you can't
use a slash, to work around this you can use the systems safe name, which is a period delimited version.
Safe names may only contain URL safe characters including a-z 0-9 and underscores (dashes are reserved). For more information
on safe names vs. pretty names read the section on importing categories.
[[/SECTION]]



[[SUBSECTION]Remote System Synchronization]

A new option labeled "Remote System Synchronization" has been added to Data Import.
This feature will delete products which were not found in the import file.
This is very handy if you are issued a new CSV by a distributor,
or another system such as a Point of Sale which will does not include a list of the products to be removed.
This will remove any products which are not included in the import
file thereby avoiding the need to tediously compare the Zoovy database, with the remote database by hand.
[[/SECTION]]



[[SUBSECTION]Configure Management Categories]

Management categories are the structure you use to organize your data.
They do not appear on the website. When you reach 50 products the online product editor will display items in folders
which include ranges of products. You can create your own folders (called management categories) using the Zoovy product
manager, or the CSV import.
[[/SECTION]]


[[SUBSECTION]Reorder navigation categories after import]

This simply rebuilds the sort order for each navigation category.
[[/SECTION]]


[[SUBSECTION]Perform non-destructive import]

Normally a import will delete the original product and the rebuild the product from the data contained on the row in the CSV.
A non-destructive import will only update the fields which have columns in the CSV, all other fields will remain intact.
Products track a considerable amount of data such as eBay preferences, and website display settings - if import in a non-destructive
fashion then you will overwrite this data.

[[SECTION]Frequently Asked Questions]


<b>Q: How do I find a specific attribute that i'm looking for?</b><br>
A: the easiest way to find specific attributes is to actually set them, then EXPORT the data using the Data Export tool in the Manage area of the site.<br>
<br>

<b>Q: Whats the difference between %INVENTORY and zoovy:inv_stock?</b><br>
A: zoovy:inv_stock is a product attribute which enables inventory checking for the product,
%INVENTORY tells the import process to create an actual inventory record.
Both properties must be set properly in order for inventory to work correctly. <br>
<br>

<b>Q: How do I figure out the name for some specific Marketplace attribute?</b><br>
A: You need to look in the channel definition. There are two ways to do this:<br>
#1. Use the Zoovy Product Manager, go into the C:\program files\zoovy\data\templates and look for a filename named
marketplace.definition.xml (for example ebay.auction.xml) then proceed to load the file up in an XML browser such as IE. The channel definition
specifies the fields that are used with each channel definition. In each &lt;INPUT&gt; tag you will see a NAME="product:zoovy:field" the zoovy:field
portion is the tag you are looking for. (Advanced users: You can actually edit the channel definition, by creating a directory called "custom"
under the templates directory, and saving your channel definition there.)<br>
#2. Go to Manage | Channel Manager, then select a channel you want to view, then click the "View Definition" link. <br>
<br>

<b>Q: How can I update the inventory for options?</b><br>
A: Just use two columns %PRODUCTID, %INVENTORY<br>
<br>

<b>Q: Change All Product Flows</b><br>
The easiest way to change all your product pages to one flow is to use the Product Power Tool.
However it can also be done using the CSV Import utility.
Simply create a list of your products (perhaps using the list all products link in the Product management area of the website), and then creating a CSV file with two columns:
%SKU,zoovy:fl
then simply put in the flow number or name (if it's a custom flow you've uploaded) and then perform a non-destructive import.<br>
<br>

<b>Q: How do I mass DELETE a group of products completely?</b><br>
The fastest way to DELETE your products is through the csv import utility.
<br>Do the following -- 
<br>1.) Create a csv file with two columns: %DELETE, %SKU (in this order).
<br>2.) The SKU column should be populated with products to delete.
<br>3.) Populate the FIRST column (%DELETE) with the value: Y.
<br> ** Uppercase Y deletes the products, associated images and inventory.<br>
For example, the spreadsheet will look like this --<br>
<table>
<tr>
<td valign='top' nowrap bgcolor="EEEEEE">%DELETE</td>
<td valign='top' nowrap bgcolor="EEEEEE">%SKU</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign='top' nowrap bgcolor="EEEEEE">Y</td>
<td valign='top' nowrap bgcolor="EEEEEE">SKU1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign='top' nowrap bgcolor="EEEEEE">Y</td>
<td valign='top' nowrap bgcolor="EEEEEE">SKU2</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br>** 4.) Perform a product CSV import: 
Setup >> CSV Import Utility >> Product
<br> Uncheck all but the last option and upload your CSV.<br>

<br>
<b>Q: Why can't I update the reserved inventory quantities?</b><br>
A: Reserved inventory quantities are calculated by the number of items reserved in channels plus the number of items reserved in external items.<br>
It is automatically computed. If you want to reserve inventory create an external item and assign it to yourself.<br>
<br>
<b>Q: Importing Navigation Categories</b><br>
Categories in Zoovy have two different names - Pretty Names, and Safe Names. As you might expect pretty names are what is displayed to a user.
A pretty name can consist of any character including commas, slashes (e.g. TCP/IP) and pretty much any other character you can think of. Safe
names are category names which do not contain any characters other than a-z0-9 and underscores. Safe names are used as part of the
URL (e.g. http://yourname.zoovy.com/category/safe.name/). Save names are delimited by periods, for each branch in a tree. Safenames always
start with a period. The formula used by Zoovy for generating safenames is to translate one or more occurance of any non-legal character to
an underscore. e.g.: This is a Test 123!!!! would be translated to .this_is_a_test_123_ (notice how the trailing !!! was translated to a single
underscore).<br>
<br>
When importing categories you have two options:<br>
<br>
<u>Method 1: Safenames</u><br>
The easiest way to use safenames is to create the entire category hierarchy in the website builder and then simply use the safenames
which are automatically generated. <br>
In order to do this, you will need to enable the feature "Do Not Encode Categories" so that the categories
are not encoded. Please note however, that you are responsible for ensuring that only valid safename characters appear.  "If you screw them
up, then it can be a bit tricky to unscrew." .. it's also worth mentioning you can specify safenames which do not exist yet, and then simply
go in and rename those categories with pretty names later. But be careful Zoovy will not create the tree, so if you specify a product in category
.level1.level2.level3 and you don't create .level1 and .level1.level2 then you'll have mixed results trying to maintain .level1.level2.level3.
If you've read this far, then it's also worth mentioning that sub categories are sorted by alphanumerically by safename. So for example
.level1.asdf comes before .level1.foo. You can use stupid tricks here to sort categories by specifying safe names like 1first 2second 3third 4fourth
<br>
<u>Method 2: Pretty Names</u><br>
The problem with pretty names is that you cannot specify multiple categories. We've had suggestions how to deal with multiple categories, using
a variety of techniques such as comma delimted, slash delimited, etc. All this works fine until you have to import a category using a name such
as "TCP/IP, and other stuff." .. so if you just pretty names you're going to be limited to importing into the first category.<br>
<br>
You can specify multiple categories to put a product in by using %CATEGORY1 %CATEGORY2 %CATEGORY3, etc. <br>
%CATEGORY by itself is for the products management category, management categories are used by product manager and on the website to
logically organize products, they don't have anything to do with navigation. Management categories must start with a / and are delimited
by forward slashes (/). they can contain only the characters A-Z0-9 and underscores.<br>
<br>
If you're feeling exceptionally lazy you can also use %HOMEPAGE as a 1 or 0 to place a product on the homepage.<br>
[[/SECTION]]


[[SECTION]Custom Attributes]

You can create your own custom attributes. Simply name the attributes username:whatever where username is your system assigned
username, and whatever is the name of the tag. Tag names can be letters, numbers, and underscores. We recommend you review the
list of system assigned attributes and attempt to map those those whenever possible, since they will ensure greater compatibility
