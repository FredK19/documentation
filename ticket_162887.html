Platform: na
Topic: desktop<br>
Question: We downloaded Zoovy Integrated Desktop Suite yesterday and cannot sign on to the Order Manager. The id and password we put in are not accepted.
<br>
Answer: It sounds like we need to do a database and/or account security configuration.  Please follow these steps.
<br>
1. click to open up Zoovy Integrated desktop, but do not log in.<br>
2. click admin > database config<br>
3. click SOHO<br>
4. Input the Zoovy master username and password<br>
5. click save<br>
6. click admin > account security<br>
7. Input the Zoovy master username and password<br>
8. Click Update<br>

You should now be able to log in normally.  If you still have problems, please open a ticket with Zoovy Technical Support
