<h2>What is the problem?</h2>
Probably your first step should be to analyze and figure out what your problem is. Our integration with Google Analytics makes it easy to determine if you are having trouble getting traffic to your site or if they are getting to your site and dropping off before making a purchase. These are two distinctly different situations that need to be approached differently.

<h2>Do you have products available for purchase?</h2>
This may seem like an obvious question but you would be surprised how often this is the reason for low sales volume.

<h3>GoogleBase</h3>
GoogleBase is easy to setup, does not reserve inventory and it is free. If you have the XSELL flag (i.e., the Cross-sell Bundle) it is a no-brainer. You should be using GoogleBase.

<h3>Amazon</h3>
Amazon is a strong marketplace but not everyone can sell there. Amazon is "invite only." Further, they have many different kinds of accounts. You want to make certain that you get a Seller Central account. If you are interested in applying, you may do so at sellercentral.amazon.com

<h3>EBay</h3>
Even sellers who feel they cannot make money off of EBay may find some use from this monolithic marketplace as a customer acquisition tool. Although other marketplaces have made significant headway, EBay remains a popular site for first time e-commerce shoppers. With Zoovy, your EBay auctions close to your Zoovy site where the customer is given a chance to add to his/her order and subscribe to your newsletter. As a Zoovy seller, use EBay to find customers who are interested in the product you sell. Next time, rather than go to EBay they may go directly to your webstore.
