<h1>Specialty Site Hosting (Mult-Stores, Niche Stores)</h1>






<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>

Specialty Site Hosting gives you many opportunities to maximize your exposure and profit margins.  With specialty site hosting you can host multiple ecommerce websites with the convenience of only managing one back end.  This can help you on the SEO and Google Ad words front.  Specialty Site Hosting can allow you to sell the same products on multiple websites at different price points and the list of possibilities goes on.  Please contact an implementation specialist if you need help strategizing for your specialty sites.

<h3>Example: Promotional Site</h3>
Domain names through Zoovy are cheap ($10 per year). Grabbing up specialized Domain Names such as www.crazy-deals-on-some-product.com is a great way to grab customer interest.

Having a regular domain name rather than a subdomain name is key especially when you are putting together a direct mail campaign.

<h3>Example: Targeted Genre</h3>
Creating sites that cater to specific demographics of your customer is a great way to improve sales. For example if you sell products which are suitable for adults, and a handful of adult/teen products then creating a more "youth oriented" version of your site with those products that caters to teens can generate more sales.

Other examples include jewelry manufacturers who create specialty sites that feature celtic designs, or more dark goth/counter culture sites at alternate domain names - while still maintaining a professional "high end" primary website. It is very rare that a soccer mom who attends church every Sunday and a tatooted biker will buy from the same website, even if they both might buy cross related jewelry.

Elder customers often have a hard time reading small print, remember sites oriented towards a more mature audience should use themes that feature BIG PRINT - you're customers will reward you with additional sales!

<h3>Example: CPC Optimization/Conversion</h3>
You can increase your ROI on Cost Per Click (CPC) advertising by creating sites that cater to specific customers based on search criteria. For example if sell golf clubs, then you probably sell both right and left handed golf clubs. A specialty site with a domain titled "Left-Handed-Golf.com" that has only left handed products will more than likely have a higher click-through conversion rate than a more generic site such as "golf-emporium", this means you don't necessarily need to outbid your competitors to generate more sales than them!

<section>
<h3>Example: Manufacturer Site</h3>
Using the subdomain feature on zoovy you can create specialty sites that feature a specific manufacturers products. For example spiffyco.yourdomain.com could point at a root category that only contains SpiffyCo products, by having the word spiffyco in your domain name some search engines may give the URL preferential treatment.

<h3>Cost and Fees</h3>

<div>
Any changes you make to the products in a category used by a specialty site, will affect the category - and therefore also affect any other site using those categories.

<h3>Multiple Domain Names</h3>
Sometimes you may want to grab multiple domain names that will point to the same specialty site. A common example is plural version of domains, such as BLUEWIDGET.com and BLUEWIDGETS.com .. both those domains are the same company, in this case you can either configure Redirect Domains, or you can configure both domains as specialty sites that share the same profile. 

For more information on setting up a redirect domain please visit: 
<a class="linkdoc" href="#?doc=50707">Doc 50707</a>

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
Neither technique is better than the other. If you use a redirect domain then all sales will be recorded under the primary domain, and you won't be able to break out sales per domain, if you have multiple domains hosted at the same site. 

</div>
</aside>


</section>

<section>
<h3>Using Profiles</h3>
Each "group" of domains that share a company logo, navigation, pricing schedule, and other information will all use the same profile. 

Each profile has a unique homepage, about us, contact us, and returns policy. 
For more information about profiles please visit: <a class="linkdoc" href="#?doc=50706">Doc 50706</a>

The default profile cannot be used with a specialty site. The default profile is used for all non-specialty domains. 
</section>


<section>
<h3>Categories</h3>
Each specialty site has a unique root category. You can choose either the same root category of your default site, OR select a subcategory of your root category. 
You can also create hidden categories and use those, or you may also use 
sub categories of a hidden category. 
For more information on creating categories please visit: 
<a class="linkdoc" href="#?doc=50557">Doc 50557</a>

A key to successfully understanding specialty sites is realizing that they share the navigation categories will ALL other sites. 
If two specialty sites, which use two different profiles, both share the same ROOT category, then any products added or removed from one site will ALSO be added and removed from the other. 

To avoid this behavior make sure both specialty sites use different root categories. The most common way to do this is by creating hidden categories and then using those for the specialty sites (unless you want two sites to share the same products, then it's a GREAT feature)

</section>

<section>
<h3>Site Look and Feel</h3>
The look and feel of a specialty site is determined by the theme you select, and which root category you choose.
Only custom themes, and themes which you have "Remembered" in the theme chooser will appear from the list of choices you have available. 
If you do not select a wrapper then the default wrapper from your primary site will be used.

<h2>Advanced</h2>

<section>
<h3>Syndication</h3>
Syndication is done based on partition.  When all sites are on one partition all the
specialty sites pull from the root category.<br>
<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>
This means that if you have multiple profiles configured for google product search, mapping categories on a specialty site will also cause them to be mapped under the main profile using the root [ . ] regardless if category for specialty site is hidden.
<br>
The solution is to use partitions and unique categories or to create hidden categories for each website and retire the [ . ] root to eliminate that umbrella factor.

<section>
<h3>Pricing Schedules</h3>
If you have the wholesale feature bundle enabled on your account you can create specialty sites where all the pricing on a site follows a specific schedule.  

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
Shipping rules and Advanced Promotions can be activated/de-activated by which pricing schedule is in use. 
This enables specialty sites to have different promotions and/or pricing.

Order Manager version 5.156 and higher support the ability to create sales reports by 
specialty domain in the Advanced Reporting feature.

<aside class="hint">
