<h1>Guide to Custom HTML Wizards</h1>
<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>

An HTML wizard
can include information from the merchants profile, from the product being
used, and from the channel it is being created in.&nbsp; HTML Wizards typically
combine data like the product name, description, along with merchant shipping
policy, and payment details.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">The Zoovy Product Manager comes
pre-packaged with many HTML Wizards which are classified as either SIMPLE
or ADVANCED. For the merchants that have special requirements, or just
want their very own look, Zoovy provides a method for creating custom HTML
Wizards.</font><br><br>
NOTE: If you remove the email address from any of the pre-formatted HTML Wizards, the system will remove your customer service email address from your company information.  Please select an HTML Wizard that does not contain a field for your email address if you do not wish to include your email in the auction.
</article>
<article>
<h2>Components</h2>

Each HTML Wizard has three files:</font>
<li> A TXT file - (called the definition file) which describes the data that should be provided to complete the HTML Wizard.
<li> A HTML File - contains the HTML content which will be interpolated with the data that is entered from the definition file.
<li> A Thumbnail (optional) - used to provide a preview of the HTML Wizard for users.</font></li>
</article>
<article>
<h2>Editing an Existing HTML Wizard</h2>


<li>
Start the Product Manager, open an auction template (drag and drop a product onto a channel from within the "product/channel creation" tab).

<li>
Click the "Html Wizard" button next to the description. Here you will find the default HTML Wizards. Select one that fits your needs best.

<li> Use Windows Explorer and browse to the C:\Program Files\Zoovy\ProdMgr\HtmlWiz directory.
If during setup, you installed the Product Manager in a different location, navigate there.

From either the "Advanced","Layout1","Custom",
or "Simple" directories select a set of HTML Wizard files to copy. You
should be able to find files named after the default templates with ".txt",
".html", and ".gif" extensions.<br>

The next step is to edit the index.txt file found within the "Custom" directory.
Open this file with a simple text Editor. In it you will see content which looks like:
<aside class="html">
<h6></h6>
<code>

&lt;STUFF&gt;
&lt;TEMPLATE NAME="NAME1"&gt;Description...&lt;/TEMPLATE&gt;
&lt;TEMPLATE NAME="NAME2">Description...&lt;/TEMPLATE&gt;
&lt;/STUFF&gt;

</code>
</aside>



</article>

<h2>Editing the Definition</h2>

The process
of creating or editing a custom HTML auction template requires 2 files,
and if you want things to look pretty a thumbnail. The first file is a
".html" that contains the actuall template HTML and comment tags. The comment
tags are specially formatted to be replaced later with actual product data.
The second file is a ".txt" that contains HTML'ish code used to define
the data inputted into the ".html" file. The last ".gif" file is used to
display a thumbnail from within the Product Manager. In the following example
(continuation the above) we will add a simple text box that is used to
relay the quality of the item going up for auction.

</article>
<article>
<h2>Editing the HTML</h2>


Open the ".html" file and enter make any changes to the templates HTML you like.
Note the existence of comments such as &lt;!-- SUPPORT_EMAIL --&gt; or
&lt;!-- PRODUCT_DESCRIPTION --&gt;. <br>
<br>
<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>

If you are cutting and pasting HTML, do not use Microsoft Office HTML (Word). The Office specific unicode
tags will cause garbage (foreign characters such as "ï¿½" to be entered into your HTML.  This is also true if
you add HTML to your product descriptions.
</div>
</aside>


<br>
These will on launch be switched out with data specified in the ".txt" file.
We entered the following HTML just above the Payment Policy section.
The Zoovy HTML Wizard allows you to easily generate custom HTML pages for
insertion into marketplaces that allow HTML listings. The HTML Wizard has
three easy steps to it:<br>

<li> Step 1: Select a Template - Choose from a variety
of pre-designed templates which are included with Product Manager.
<li> Step2:
Review/Edit Data - Product Manager will prompt you to review and enter
various pieces of information which is required for the HTML template,
in most cases the information you enter will be saved into your product,
or your company profile.
<li> Step 3: Review Output - after pressing save on
the edit screen you will have the opportunity to view the final output,
and to save the HTML generated code into the Channel. <br>
<Br>
Advanced Users:
Make your own custom template that only asks you for the information that is
different on every auction.
<li>
Load up Windows Explorer (not Internet Explorer)  a quick and easy way to do this is to
go to the Start Button then Run and then type in C:\ and finally press
Ok. There will a total of three files for each HTML wizard theme eg: GREYBOX1.html
GREYBOX1.txt GREYBOX1.gif<br>
<br>
Congratulations you've just added your own custom HTML Wizard,
you can repeat the steps above over and over again,

The three files we copied earlier, have the following:<br>
<br>
<section>
<h3>Thumbnail</h3>

GREYBOX1.gif is the thumbnail preview of what the template looks like,
if you don't want to make your own thumbnail then just use a graphic that
lets you know what it is, or disregard it completely.
</article>
<section>
<h3>Definition</h3>

GREYBOX1.txt is the list of information needed
by the HTMLWIZ that is then combined with the contents of GREYBOX1.html
to create the final HTML for your listing. You can edit the GREYBOX1.txt
and change the list of information needed, for example you could remove
it so it does not prompt you for your logo, payment policy, return policy,
etc. and then you could edit GREYBOX1.html and design it so payment policy,
return policy, etc. are not part of the auction. In the GREYBOX1.txt you
might find the following tag:
<aside class="html">
<h6></h6>
<code>

&lt;input TYPE="TEXTBOX" NAME="merchant:zoovy:prod_desc"
	PROMPT="Product Description" SUB="FOO"&gt;&lt;/input&gt;

</code>
</aside>


The TYPE= parameter tells it what type of input element you are dealing with,
valid types are TEXTBOX, TEXTAREA, and IMAGE The NAME= tells the product
manager which data attribute to load the data from, obtain a list of commonly
used field names, or create your own. In the following example replace
yourname with your username, then somename with a valid tag name which
can be any combination of letters or numbers. You can create global fields
by going: merchant:yourname:somename , or fields which are associated with
a product by using the format: product:yourname:somename The PROMPT field
is what is displayed to you, the user of the HTML Wizard that tells you
want to put in that field. Finally, the SUB= field tells the HTML Wizard
to substitute the contents of what you entered into the GREYBOX1.html file.

</article>
<section>
<h3>HTML File</h3>

In the GREYBOX1.html file you would have the following code:
<aside class="html">
<h6></h6>
<code>

&lt;!-- FOO --&gt;

</code>
</aside>


would be replaced with whatever data was entered into the
<aside class="html">
<h6></h6>
<code>

&lt;input SUB="FOO" .. &gt; tag.

</code>
</aside>



The name isn't important, just make sure whatever is inside the data of the SUB= also appears inside an HTML comment in the .html file.

<h2>Supported Properties</h2>


Here is a table of all supported
INPUT TYPES and their respective properties.
<table BORDER valign="top" >
<tr>
	<td VALIGN=TOP>INPUT TYPE</td>
	<td VALIGN=TOP>PROPERTIES</td>
	<td VALIGN=TOP>SUB BEHAVIOR</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td VALIGN=TOP>(any input type)</td>
	<td VALIGN=TOP>
	<b>PROMPT</b> - the prompt displayed to the user. e.g. "Enter Something Here" <br>
	<b>SUB</b> - the name of the variable to be replaced in the text. (read	the SUB VALUES) in the adjacent columns for more info how substution works.<br>
	<b>TYPE</b> - specifies the input type (choose from the values below) e.g. INPUT="TEXTBOX"
	<b>NAME</b> - the namespace:owner:attribute to save/load data from.<br>
	<b>LOADFROM</b> - the default value to load from if NAME= is not populated, in namespace:owner:attribute. Can accept a comma separated list of values<br>
	<b>READONLY</b> - values are 0 or 1 makes a field non-editable, this is especially useful if you are referencing data on the parent form, such as channel:ebay:title, or do not want to allow the user to accidentally edit the information e.g. product:zoovy:prod_name<br>
	<b>VALUE</b> - the default value, if nothing can be found in NAME, or LOADFROM values.<br>
	<b>PRETEXT</b> - a text string which is prepended to the input if the data is not a blank.<br>
	<b>POSTTEXT</b> - a text string which is appended to the input string if the data is not a blank.<br>
	<b>URLENCODE</b> - if 1 then performs url encoding (&amp; becomes %37), encodes all non-alpha numeric characters. (used for passing data to another program via an HTTP GET)<br>
	<b>ENTITYENCODE</b> - if 1 then performs basic entity encoding (&amp; becomes &amp;amp;, &lt; becomes &amp;lt;, &gt; becomes &amp;gt;  &quot; becomes &amp;quot;) handy for escaping forms inside forms, etc.<br>
	</td>
	<td VALIGN=TOP>By default all INPUT's replace their substitute (SUB) name.
		For example: SUB="FOO" would replace all occurances of &lt;!-- FOO --&gt; throughout the HTML. Other special input type's such as IMAGE also create additional SUBNAME_VALUE variables which can be used.
