<h2>Creating new Incomplete Items</h2>

By creating incomplete items you can let people check out and pay for items which were not listed through Zoovy. For example if a losing bidder contacts you after an auction ends and says they would like to be able to purchase items at the winning price and you agree, then you could simply create an incomplete item and the item would be processed just like any other item purchased through an auction.

<h2>Non Paying Bidders</h2>

Each marketplace has different policies when it comes to Non-paying bidders, 
you should refer to the channel details to learn more about how each marketplace handles non-paying bidders.
The incomplete items screen lists which items have not been paid for. If you are using the eBay Unpaid Item dispute 
any incomplete items you have open disputes for will remain in the incomplete items folder of Order Manager 
(in either Web Manager or Zoovy Order Manager.)
