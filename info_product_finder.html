<h2>Finder Overview</h2>

A Finder is a predefined set of search parameters which will allow your customers to easily find what they're looking for.  For instance, a dropdown list of 'genres' to help your customers find what toy they're looking for.  Or checkboxes of 'colors' to allow them to find clothing of a specific color.

<br>

Finders can also contain multiple search parameters and types, such as clothing style as a dropdown and color as checkboxes.  That way the customer can search for hats that are red, blue or khaki.<br>

Regardless of whether you decide to use the theme, or layout enabled finder configuration, you will need to configure a FINDER search catalog in the Setup >> Manage Search Catalogs interface.

A 'product finder' is different than a finder.  A product finder is used in the Zoovy interface to allow merchants to find and select product to appear in a given list or category page.

<h2>Adding a finder to your store</h2>

<section>
<h3>Using the right theme or layout</h3>
In order to use a finder, you must be using a theme or layout that supports one.  Shoptastic and Bluelicious are two examples of themes that have a finder.  There is also an advanced search layout that has multiple finders (ID: 5006).

<h3>Mapping your products</h3>
In order for a finder to work, you must first create an option group to be searched.  Option groups are covered more thoroughly in this document:
<a class="linkdoc" href="#?doc=50319">Doc 50319</a> 
<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
Option groups must be Store Option Groups (SOGs), as Product Option Groups (POGs) will not be recognized by the search engine.

</div>
</aside>

<br>
Once the option group has been created, you must map your products to the appropriate data fields.

<h2>Enabling the finder via layout/theme</h2>

Now that you have your product mapped to specific option fields, you need to set the finder up to search this option group.  Edit the page/theme that has the finder element in it.

<aside class="cbc">
<h6>Enabling the Finder</h6>
<div>
<li>Click 'edit' next to the finder prompt</li>
<li>Enter a prompt that will appear on your store next to the search field (this should be short and reflect the option group that will be searched)</li>
<li>Select the group to be searched</li>
<li>Check/Uncheck 'ANY' as needed</li>
<li>Select the display (most DEFAULTS are a select list)</li>
<li>Push the 'Add to Finder Text' button</li>
<li>If you are adding multiple search parameters, repeat these steps.  If there will only be one search parameter (one dropdown, for instance)then you are done.  Click the save button</li>
<li>Check the appearance of the finder on the theme/page you are using it to ensure aesthetics</li>

</div>

A finder may be template specific, so check the theme or layout you are using in the editor for special instructions
