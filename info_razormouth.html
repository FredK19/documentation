RazorMouth is an affiliate network that acts as a middle man or link
between proggers (product bloggers) and merchants.  Proggers will write about
your products and insert text links or banners (images) in their blogs that
link to your product pages.  You create the links and banners that you want
them to use in your RazorMouth account.<BR><BR>

When someone clicks through one of their links and then makes a purchase from
your site, RazorMouth pays the progger a commission (from the account balance
in your RazorMouth account).<BR><BR>

If you need assistance with creating the links and banners, please schedule an
implementation appointment at your convenience.<BR><BR>

A note from the employees over at Razormouth:
<br>
RazorMouth would like to start off by saying we are excited about offering Zoovy clients an opportunity to join our unique and revolutionary marketing program. Unlike other marketing programs RazorMouth incorporates the power of InfoNetFusion! This means that RazorMouth utilizes the power of several different Direct Market Media to dramatically increase exposure and seriously drive traffic to your products. Just one of the ways that we do this is through our revolutionary Progger (Product Blogger) base.<BR>
<br>
This is truly a unique opportunity for Zoovy Merchants to opt into RazorMouth prior to our official public launch. What does this mean? It means that when our infomercials hit national television on 11/21/2008 your product will already be in RazorMouth and as our site swells with thousands of Proggers looking for a product to represent and sell yours will be one of the first ones available.
<br>
Unlike other marketing companies RazorMouth's Proggers are trained step by step by the world’s leading expert in Progging! This means that your products will be very well represented and showcased according to your own terms and conditions. Our Proggers have read and learned step by step how to be successful at selling any product online. They are trained in blogging, keywords, adwords, negative adwords and much much more.
<br>
In this initial offering to Zoovy Clients we are happy to say that there will be no "Network Access Fee" and "No Monthly Minimums"! RazorMouth only collects on your Progger Payouts we call this our no hassle pay as you play program. We have a flat 30% fee and the amount paid out to the Progger. So let’s say you pay your Progger $100.00 RazorMouth will calculate our Facilitation Fee of 30% on your Progger payout; in this example it would be $30.00. Our Facilitation fee is a flat 30%. RazorMouth will only collect our 30% on the amount paid to the Progger. All payments are sent and received through PayPal. So the standard PayPal fees apply to all money transactions.
