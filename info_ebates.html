<h2>Concept Overview</h2>



eBates is the original reverse affiliate program. Merchants routinely offer an affiliate commission for referred sales. In a reverse affiliate model, a portion of the funds paid to the affiliate are shared with the customer. eBates was established in 1999 and has a large network of approximately 6 million members who give purchasing preference to sites which participate in the eBates program. 

<br>

eBates members can also choose to donate their savings to a charity organization of their choice.  Many high profile charity organizations encourage their members to shop through eBates whenever possible.

<br>

Historically eBates has only worked with major online Affiliate programs such as commission Junction, Clixgalore, or Kowabunga to board merchants - however merchants would typically pay thousands of dollars in setup fees, plus an additional 3-5% commission fee to the affiliate provider. Zoovy clients have no setup costs, plus no additional per transaction fees.  Through a unique offering between our companies eBates commissions will simply appear on your Zoovy invoice.  This offer is currently exclusive to Zoovy.

If you are interested in signing up with eBates, please submit a support ticket with a subject of 'Ebates'.

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<section>
<h3>Can I select which products go to eBates?</h3>
No. eBates merely provides a link to your store, so all products are eligible. 
</section>

<section>
<h3>What is the amount of the minimum monthly service fee?</h3>

The contract refers the potential for a future monthly minimum fee, however at this time there is no minimum fee, nor is one even on the road-map. 

<br>

Prior to the arrangement with Zoovy - eBates only focused on Internet Retailer Top 500 merchants. In fact Zoovy is the only e-commerce provider to partner with eBates to allow companies doing less than $25m/yr in online sales to easily participate without paying very large setup/integration fees through third parties such as commission junction.  

<br>

eBates was concerned about the quality of customer that might be referred and requested we build into the contract the option of a minimum fee to maintain active accounts in case they later determined it was in their best interest to eliminate smaller accounts.

eBates has been in business since 1999 and only works directly with the largest online sellers. They are NOT interested in having hundreds of thousands of companies on their platform.  Zoovy is excited to be able to offer their services to smaller clients who would normally not be eligible.  This is a new endeavor for eBates and we are happy to be supporting them.

<h3>How is the eBates revenue share percentage determined?</h3>

eBates employs people who look at the composition of your products, they evaluate each domain based on it's current composition of products.  Their recommendation is the "minimum discount" to be considered competitive against existing major brandname retailers they already have. If you would like to provide more of a discount please let us know. 

</section>

<section>
<h3>Does it matter which domain name is used?</h3>
No. eBates will review each domain on a domain by domain basis. 
However if you allow shopping carts to be transferred across stores, then the discount and tracking code will also be transferred to the other store. 
</section>

<section>
<h3>Why does eBates not allow me to do other advertising?</h3>

It doesn't. It seems some people get confused by the contract verbiage:

<aside class="html">
<h6></h6>
<code>
"... Merchant agrees not to offer any off-site banner links, link exchanges,
web-rings, or offer other affiliate links which may direct the Shopper to purchase
products from other /non-tracked/ websites ..."

</code>
</aside>


To clarify: You can have eBates send buyers to your site, and then you send those buyers someplace else (besides your site) to make a non-tracked purchase. The agreement doesn't prohibit you from advertising YOUR site on other sites, or using affiliate programs, to drive traffic to your site.  Rather it prohibits you from hosting banners which send buyers to other sites, and or adding links to affiliate products to your site.

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
It's worth mentioning that Zoovy has the same rule in our terms of service. If we find adwords, or affiliate products (anything where we can't track the sales via our checkout) on a merchant website then we have the right to terminate the site with no warning per our terms of service. 

<br>

Zoovy provides hosting and bandwidth for contingency based on percentage of sales model, when those sales can't be tracked then we are providing the services and we have no chance of collecting any fees.

<h3>Can I setup and use a pricing schedule for eBates referral customers?</h3>

This is a clear violation of the terms of service and spirit of the eBates agreement. 

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
You can select which domains are eligible for participation with eBates, and
obviously those domains may have alternative pricing schedules.

Blatant violations could result in eBates revoking your referral privileges. We recommend you do not do this.  Zoovy technical support is not available to assist you with this, so please do not ask.
