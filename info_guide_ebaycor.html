<h1>eBay Checkout Redirect</h1>
<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>

eBay Checkout Redirect is a new way for eBay Buyers to pay Zoovy sellers
for their eBay items.
With Checkout Redirect, after an eBay Auction, Fixed Price, Store Listing,
or Second Chance listing is finalized and the buyer clicks the "Pay Now"
button they are automatically transported to an eBay-ified version of the
Zoovy checkout. <br>
<br>
This feature is automatically enabled for all 2.0 customers.
We encourage you to watch the video presentation to see an example
of how this feature appears to the consumer.

<h2>Checkout Difference</h2>

When a buyer is paying via Checkout Redirect there is no need for them
to provide their email address, the "Pay Now" functionality goes directly
into the Zoovy checkout.<br>
<br>
If multiple products are won, then all non-checked out items will be 
merged into a single cart together.<br>
<br>
If one or more products has non-inventoriable options, then the buyer 
will still need to utilize the "claim" page (in future releases we 
plan to address this). For now, these items will be listed without the
Checkout Redirect feature enabled.<br>
<br>
If a customer already has an account with your store, they will 
automatically be logged in. They will not need to provide a username/
password - as long as their email address, or eBay username on file with 
eBay is the same as the one in your store (if not, then a new account will
be created for them, based on your checkout setup).<br>
<br>
The buyers name, shipping address, and email will automatically be populated
with the information on file at eBay.<br>
<br>
In the eBay Checkout mode, if Paypal is available as a payment option it 
will appear as the first payment option and be the "preferred" payment method.
If a merchant account/credit card payment option is  available
it appear below paypal (normally credit cards would appear before Paypal).<br>
<br>
During an eBay checkout the default wrapper for your store is changed to 
an wrapper that resembles the eBay site. This increases buyer confidence, 
however this wrapper also does not have any navigation so it is not possible
for the buyer to add additional store items to their cart.<br>
<br>
In the future eBay will allow us to allow the buyer to navigate through
your Zoovy store and purchase additional items (which will also be reported
to eBay and included in the final value fee total). This will be a 
configurable option - which you can choose to enable or disable. At this
time we have no ETA for this feature.
