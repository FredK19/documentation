<h6>Check your import file</h6>
<div>
Verify that your import headers conform to Zoovy import standards.  Check for spaces, strange characters, and verify casing matches what is displayed in the webdoc.  Note that as soon as this file is imported, all orders listed will have tracking appended.  Depending on your configuration, this may move your orders automatically to completed, and trigger your STATCOMP email.  It's suggested that you create a template with the proper headers, and copy/paste your End of day information to avoid issue.

<h2>Multiple Packages</h2>
UPS (multiple boxes) option is used for split shipments.  For example, if you have a customer that ordered three items that need to be shipped in two boxes, you would use this option.  Keep in mind that when you use this the shipment will split according to SKU or product ID.

invoice number. If you type in an invoice number, you will need to enter
underscore as the invoice number. For example 2003-05-2569 needs to be input
