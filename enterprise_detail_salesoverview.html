<h1>Enterprise Feature Overview</h1>
<article>
<h2>Summary</h2>

Zoovy Enterprise allows Zoovy Merchant customers to scale to the next level of business by offering multi-user launching, and multi-user order management and CRM functionality. 
Zoovy Enterprise uses a local server to coordinate the business activities
and offers centralized access control, and seamless synchronization with the Zoovy system.
Enterprise also offers optional bar coding and an integrated wireless inventory system, that can assign/print barcodes,
or use manufacturer UPC or ISBN's for storing and locating items in the warehouse. <br>
<br>

Zoovy began work on Enterprise in March of
2002, and released its first version in May of 2002. 
Based on customer feedback we went back to the drawing board and re-engineered the product and expect to re-release it in early 2007. 

<br>
Zoovy knows that in any business the single largest expense is employee time, Enterprise
dramatically reduces costs by improving employee efficiency, and using automation whenever possible.
