<h1>Inventory / Product Configuration</h1>
<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>

<b>Inventory Options for a Product:</b><br>
Website Display: To configure how Inventory products will be displayed on your website, go to Setup | My Store Properties | Inventory Settings.<p>
<li><b>Inventory Setting:</b> Track inventory is enabled by default. All products in the Zoovy system will have inventory enabled and will require an inventory quantity.
That quantity can be unlimited.  If the product has unlimited inventory available, check the "Unlimited Quantities" checkbox.  This will tell the 
Zoovy system to automatically enter an inventory quantity of 9,999. Every time inventory finalization runs, it will be set back to that number 
whether you've sold 0 or 5000.<br>
<li><b>On Handy Quantity:</b> Enter the quantity you currently have in stock for that product.<br>
<li><b>Reserve Quantity:</b> This is the quantity of product you currently have commited to listings or orders which have not yet been completed. 
This number is accounted for by the Zoovy inventory system and can not be edited.<br>
<li><b>Location:</b> This is an optional field you can use to tell you where to find the product to fill an order.  It could be where it's boxed, 
warehoused or even what distributor or supplier you get the product from.<br>

<div><b>IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT INVENTORY UPDATES</b>:<br>
The inventory management system is designed so changes will occur as quickly as possible. All inventory updates are queued, therefore you may notice your most current updates are pending inventory finalization. 
<br><br>
Normally it takes about 10-30 minutes for inventory to finalize. In extreme cases, during maintenance windows, code updates, or other circumstances it could take several hours for inventory updates to finalize. While your product's inventory is pending finalization and its onshelf quantity is zero (0), your product is <b> NOT </b> removed from its category(s). However, your product will never be purchasable if its onshelf quantity is zero. 
<br><br>
Once your inventory has finalized: 
<li> Products are removed from your website categories if their onshelf quantity is zero 
<li> Inventory notification emails are sent 
<li> Minimum stock quantity is verified with onshelf quantity and Stock Supply Chain configured products are reordered as necessary (This only affects Stock Supply Chain products!) 
<br>
<br>
<b>If inventory finalization takes more than 12 hours to finalize, please open a support ticket.</b>

<b>More Gotchas:</b><br>
* If you have Inventory in the Setup Area configured as "For Internal Use Only" it will NOT display inventory numbers to customers,
regardless of how you have the Inventory option configured in the product itself. This is a safety mechanism for merchants who during
peak buying seasons want to immediately remove all inventory status from the website.<br>
<br>

<br>
<b>Understanding Product Inventory Options:</b><br>
<li><b>Proactive Inventory Monitoring</b>
You can choose to be notified immediately when your safety quantity is reached, and when your quantity reaches zero.
NOTE: The safety quantity cannot be configured on a per-product basis, it's a site wide thing.<br>
