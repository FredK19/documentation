<h3>Assemblies</h3>
Assemblies are options which effect inventory. An example of an assembly would be a computer that you want for your customer to be able to assemble from scratch. He could select which processor, monitor, keyboard, etc he wanted. However, you carry the processor, monitor, and keyboard individually. If you sold out of the white keyboard, you would not want that option to be available as a choice to your customers who are assembling their custom computer.

<h3>Kits</h3>
A kit is a set of items that are included in the purchase of a single item. An example of a kit would be a gift basket that consists of bath salts, robe and chocolate. You sell the bath salts, robe and chocolate individually as well as part of the gift basket.

<div> Assemblies and kits are essentially the same thing. The difference is that assemblies are part of an option and kits do not allow a customer a choice.

You need a product to represent the combination of items. In other words, if you wanted to offer a gift basket, you would have a Product ID for the gift basket as well as a Product ID for each product that is used to build the gift basket.<br>

<div> Do you need to use assemblies or kits? If you are tracking inventory on the parts used to put together some other item then you do. If you are not worried about inventory tracking of the individual parts then you don't.
