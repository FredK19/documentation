[[SECTION]I have an account with DOBA, now what?]
[[CAUTION]]You must have the <B>Supply Chain (SC) bundle</B> added to your account in order to use this integration. Feel free to set up an appointment with an Implementation Specialist. They will be very happy to help you get this integrated. [[/CAUTION]]

[[CBC]Setting up for DOBA Drop Ship]

<li>Log into Zoovy.com and go to the Utilities Tab.
<li>Click on Supply Chain Management.
<li>Click on Add a New Supplier.
<li>Enter supplier code (DOBA would be a good code, but whatever you like will work).
<li>Enter the Supplier Information (You can enter what you want here Something that makes sense to you so that you know it is DOBA would be recommended).
[[HINT]]
Website should be your website not http://www.doba.com
[[/HINT]]
<li>Ordering method: Select Drop Ship
<li>Data Integration Type: DOBA
<li>Click SAVE. 

<li>On the next page, enter your DOBA username, password and Retailer ID. Save. 
<li>Your DOBA Reseller ID can be found on DOBA under Settings: Profile

<li>If necessary, check the Prepay box to indicate you are a PrePay merchant with DOBA. (This setting will cause Zoovy to use this cost to calculate your product price (based on your MARKUP).)
<li>Setup Shipping to use "Enable Integrated Partner Shipping" if you want to use DOBA shipping quotes
<li>Select "Automatically Close Orders" under Order Delivery to automatically deliver Orders to DOBA


<li>Log into DOBA.com and 'Allow' Zoovy to be an Authorized Partner (under Settings: Profile) Note:  Configuring this setting is done through a pop up window, which unfortunately sometimes takes a bit of time to appear.
<li>Create Watchlists (Browse Catalog: Add to Watch List)

[[BREAK]]

[[HINT]]
Once your DOBA Supplier status is 'accepted'
<li>Orders will automatically be sent to DOBA
<li>Tracking information will automatically be received from DOBA
<li>Product description/price/inventory will automatically be received/updated from DOBA
<li>Merchant changes made to a DOBA product's configuration will be overridden anytime the DOBA supplier makes an update, or if the merchant selects the "Re-import My Watchlists" option.
[[/HINT]]


[[BREAK]]
[[HINT]]The orders will NOT move from Recent to Completed automatically. This is currently the way that the integration works. If there are orders that have non-DOBA items on them, the order will need to be split and the original order number should stay with the DOBA items. Shipping comes over once per day, in the evening, pacific time. You will need to move the orders with tracking to completed so that the tracking emails will go out to your customers.[[/HINT]]

[[SUBSECTION]Keep changes you have made]
If a supplier has made changes to a product when DOBA does their callback it will override any changes to that product that you have made (I.E. price change, descriptions, Meta-tags). In order to keep from having to repeat hours of product changes here is a little hint on how to quickly make these changes. After you have done all the work on your products and saved all the changes. An export of your products to a csv file that will reflect all of the changes you have made would be the fastest and easiest way to reset your changes in the future. Be sure, however, that when products become discontinued on DOBA, those changes are reflected in your csv file, and add new products to your csv file that you have added to your watch list.

[[SECTION]Update your Watchlist and Zoovy]
Once you have products in Zoovy from DOBA, what do you do when you add more products to your Watchlist and they do not come over to Zoovy?
[[BREAK]]

[[CBC]This is simple to fix.]
<li> Log in to your DOBA account
<li> Go to your Watchlist
<li> Check the 'Send Callback' box
<li> Click update
<li> Allow 5-20 minutes for the update
