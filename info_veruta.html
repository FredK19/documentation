<h1>Veruta Remarketing Integration</h1>

<h2> How does it work / How much does it cost</h2>

<section>
<h3> How much does it cost?</h3>
Zoovy has a special relationship with Veruta. Our clients do not pay normal CPE (Cost Per Experience fees) which can be very expensive and difficult to measure. Instead Zoovy clients pay a flat $5.50 base CPM (Cost Per Thousand Impressions) for branding/exposure.  Zoovy clients also gain access to other exclusive veruta features which are normally reserved for large agencies with substantial budgets. Zoovy clients receive the same transaction rates as very large agencies, however unlike large agencies our clients do not pay a minimum fee. You will only pay for what you use, and a nominal rev. share to Veruta for the resulting sales your site generates. Veruta charges will appear on your normal Zoovy invoice. 

<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>
Zoovy does not set a daily or monthly budget, defaults to $999.99 daily for each ad.  <b>It is important for merchants to set a daily budget</b> for each campaign/banner.  Decide on monthly budget divide by 30 days, then divide by 3 (or the number of active banners)  By not setting a budget, the charges will be based on your traffic and visitor tagging.

<h3>Where will my Banners appear?</h3>
Simply put: Veruta advertisements appear on sites your customers visit when they navigate away from your site (to sites that display advertisements). Veruta will only show advertisements to shoppers who have been tagged, and you only pay for advertising they deliver to your clients. Veruta currently reaches about 80% of the content sites on the Internet through its solid relationships with major media networks but the demographics vary based on your shoppers.

Once products are tagged, they will be the only products displayed in the Veruta banners.  If you want all products to be sent select the Dynamic Product Banner w/Individual product recommendation.
<br>
Merchants choosing specific dynamic lists must tag products before the Veruta ads will run.  If no products are tagged for the ad, then products can not be pulled in.

<h2>Website Visitor Tagging</h2>
Settings control which, and how often visitors are tagged for retargeting. Zoovy campaigns do not have daily budgets. 
<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>
Daily budget needs to be set up in Veruta to control monthly spend.  Especially encouraged for merchants with high traffic sites.

</div>
</aside>


Merchants should use below settings to only re-target appropriate traffic
<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>Tagging helps control budget and improve conversions
</div>
</aside>

<br>
<li> Tagging Probability - 1:1 ALL Vistors Tagged; 1:2 1 out of every 2 tagged, etc
<li> Tagging Events - qualifying events for tagging, select 1 or all<br>
Options:  Products Viewed, Categories Viewed, Cart Page, Checkout.
<li> Minimum Qualifying Events - how many events/actions there need to be before shopper is tag
<br>
When setting veruta up, please keep in mind the following information regarding 'Qualifying Events':<br>

<aside class="html">
<h6></h6>
<code>
<!--
veruta enabled recorded_events=0 required_events=1<br>
tag_products=0 tag_category=0 tag_cart=1 tag_checkout=1<br>
-->

</code>
</aside>


Here is an explanation how to read the example output:<br>
<br>
recorded_events = tracks the total number of qualifying events the user has performed.<br>
required_events = is how many qualifying events the user must perform before the veruta code is displayed.
<br>
So what is a "Qualifying Event" well based on the example above:<br>
<br>
tag_products=0 means a product view is NOT a qualifying event<br>
tag_category=0 means a category view is NOT a qualifying event<br>
tag_cart=1 means a cart view/add to cart IS a qualifying event<br>
tag_checkout=1 means entering checkout IS a qualifying event<br>
