<h2>Request Format:</h2>

Performs an HTTP POST, the REQUEST variable contains the following XML content:
<aside class="html">
<h6></h6>
<code>

&lt;INVENTORY&gt;
&lt;SKU ID="1506"/&gt;

<h2>Response Format:</h2>

Expects a HTTP Content-type of xml/success with the body of the document formatted as such:
<aside class="html">
<h6></h6>
<code>

&lt;INVENTORY&gt;
&lt;SKU ID="1506" QTY="10" RESERVE="0" LOC="SHELF_ABC"/&gt;
&lt;/INVENTORY&gt;

</code>
</aside>


NOTE: 1506 is the SKU number of the product in the local database. QTY is the actual quantity on hand, the reserve amount
(if any) will be subtracted from that based on the merchants settings. LOC is the location, and is used by applications which 
support realtime inventory lookups. (NOTE: order manager does not support LOCATION via remote API's at this time).
