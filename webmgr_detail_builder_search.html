Each Zoovy site comes with a search, and search results page.
Both pages can be edited using the website builder and can be customized per profile.

<h2>Understanding Search Results</h2>

Products which do not appear in any navigation categories will not appear in search results.  This includes products that only appear in hidden categories.

If you need to include a link to a promotional coupon on your website, then consider 
creating a hidden category, and using a buy me button to link to the product (since a 
buy me button doesn't actually put a product into a category)

<h2>Searches within Specialty Stores</h2>
A search within a specialty store will only return results for product that are in that store.  If the top level category of the specialty store (the one set as root for the specialty store) is hidden, that will not effect the search results of the specialty store, as long as the subcategories are all visible.
