<br>
Some tracking down found this to be an issue with Windows Vista.
<br>
What you can do is copy the file ORDERIDS.INI from the following directory:
C:\Program Files\Zoovy\Desktop
<br>
and place it in the following:
<br>
c:\Users\(user)\Appdata\local\VirtualStore\program files\zoovy\desktop\(Zoovy account name) 
<br>
::Where parentheses stands your computer's personal folder names and usernames.
It may be easier to manually search through folders. I noticed the folder "Appdata" is hidden, so you may need to enable view hidden files to see this one.
