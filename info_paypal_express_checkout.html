[[SECTION]Setup a Paypal Account]

Please go http://altfarm.mediaplex.com/ad/ck/3484-23890-3840-36 and create an
account. Once you have verified your account via the banking process.this could take a
few business days for them to officially verify your account.

[[CAUTION]]
Do not setup your API access (next step) until after Paypal has verified your account (which can take 3-4 business days).

[[SUBSECTION]Paypal Error 10417]
[[STAFF]]
Below is the information I received from MTS as a reply to our previous
response.  This ticket was opened for NYC I Wear. 
[[/STAFF]]

According to Paypal: 
"The reason that the 10417 error does not occur before the order is created 
is because Paypal does not contact the account holder's bank or credit card 
issuer (as appropriate) to determine transaction approval until the
DoExpressCheckoutPayment request is made.  Therefore Paypal cannot know in advance
whether or not the bank or card issuer will approve or decline the
transaction, so we cannot return an error until that time.

[[SUBSECTION]Paypal Error 10438]
10438 errors are caused when the merchant's using a customized payment page, and the HTML color value that the merchant specified is too long. HTML colors are six digits in length, with two hexadecimal values for the Red, Green, and Blue intensities. For example, to make pure red, you would specify #FF0000. If you submitted #FFF0000, the 
error 10438 would be generated.
[[/SUBSECTION]]

[[SUBSECTION]Paypal Error 10474]
10474 errors are caused by the shipping address not matching the country of residence listed (for example, submitting a shipping address in Canada, but the PayPal account is a U.S. account). This is not permitted; the buyer will need to change the shipping address to match the country of his or her residence and reattempt payment.
