<h1>Synchronization Help</h1>
<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>

Synchronization is the function that uploads any changes you have made to the Zoovy servers, and
then downloads any new orders and customer information that may have changed on the Zoovy servers.
In addition Synchronization sends any new email you have created to the customers.<Br>
<br>
Communication with the Zoovy servers occurs over a SSL secured connection so all your information
is transmitted over the highest level of Internet protocol security available.<br><br>
NOTE: If you have trouble syncing order manager, please check to see that you are not using negative quantities in any orders.  Order Manager is designed to be run on only one machine. If you have syncing problems and you have two computers that you are using order manager on, uninstall the additional copy of order manager.

Please note that when you make changes on the website, then in order manager, the last change is assumed to be right. So, if you have one person making changes on the website, and another updating status in order manager you run the risk of having status changes overwritten.
