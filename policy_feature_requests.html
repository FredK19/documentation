[[TITLE]Feature &amp; Enhancement Request Policy]
[[SECTION]Concept Overview]
[[TAG]programming=500]
[[TAG]development=500]

Enhancement / Feature requests come in three types:


[[SUBSECTION]Design]

Design enhancements to a website should be done by setting up a meeting with the graphic design department, contacting the zoovy sales dept. 

[[/SUBSECTION]]

[[SUBSECTION]Custom Development / 3rd party Integration]

Integration with 3rd parties such as suppliers, or outside reporting systems should be done by requesting a scope meeting via Billing@zoovy.com.  
These can also be discussed during a BPP meeting.

[[STAFF]]
If we receive an integration request via support ticket, BPP or Non-BPP, 
make the customer aware of this webdoc. If the customer requests to start
 a custom project, incident the ticket to lizm as a project with "FEATURE" 
as the group code.

[[SUBSECTION]Core Development]

Core Development is any feature which would be integrated into the main platform or would require changes to the software hosted at www.zoovy.com and would be available to all clients (versus "Custom Development" which is only available to a specific client). 
Core Feature requests must be submitted one of three ways:
<ul>
<li> 1. Facebook Group - if you have an idea on how to improve the product please post it into our Zoovy members only facebook group.
<li> 2. BPP Appointment - if you are in the BPP program we are still offering limited 1hr. annual BPP meetings (which must be requested) - this is a great time to propose new features.
<li> 3. Open a support ticket, or discuss with Marketing or Design (if you already have an open related project) - this method is only available for paid enhancements.
</ul>

There are several reasons for this policy:
<ol>
<li> BPP appointments give us a time to discuss/understand the business case to evaluate how this would impact the platform.
<li> Project Management personnel are aware of the existing development projects and timeframes.
<li> Core features must be approved through a vetting process since they become a 'feature' of our platform, and these vetting processes have consistently demonstrated 
the best results in choosing which features we will add. 
</ol>

[[SECTION]Why must core feature requests must go through vetting process?]

A lot of clients write us and ask us to add a feature, and then offer to pay to "entice" our development team to jump right on the project.  The fact a client is willing to pay for a feature actually has very little influence if it gets added or not. The ongoing cost of supporting a feature, or how that feature plays with other features, or if it creates an incompatibility with a partner. Core development requires more planning, more robust development/documentation, and testing than custom development - since it will often need to support more use cases than specific development which only needs to one specific client. 

[[BREAK]]

As a platform need to consider how other clients use the software currently, or what other applications also use that field - which requires we do an impact survey. 

[[BREAK]]

During the impact survey if we identify incompatibilities then it requires we add an option/selection, error messages/detection and remediation strategies.  We also need to estimate the future support costs of configuration assistance, and the additional complexity and maintenance costs of the software.  

[[BREAK]]

QA/Testing across different client types, Quickbooks versions (all supported years), it's really quite massive.  A bad release that corrupts an Enterprise clients quickbooks database could easily cost us thousands of dollars lost revenue in just a few hours - dwarfing any potential revenue gains by charging a client for adding a core feature. 

[[BREAK]]

Then there is any testing, documentation, and future compatibility concerns.  The regression testing necessary to roll out a core feature requires we test the feature on dozens or possibly even hundreds of sites.  This is generally not billable to a client and is a cost we still have to incur the costs because your change could impact other clients. 

[[BREAK]]

With a project like this the cost of adding the actual functionality is ridiculously low compared to the other associated ongoing costs of adding "yet-another option".  This is the reason for so many projects we choose to have the client go with a third party or develop a custom solution. 

[[BREAK]]

Over the past years we've really tried to do our best to improve the software quality and unfortunately it has required we put processes like this in place so that we're not randomly breaking things with each new version of our software.  We also have a very strict moratorium on adding new configuration options to the software, and a roadmap with commitments to clients.  Core features will typically take at least 3 months, and as long as a couple of years to work their way into the product - this gives our clients the stability they need to operate their businesses successfully.

[[SECTION]Please provide a business case]

Thank you for taking the time to submit this feature request.
<br><br>

We receive literally hundreds of feature suggestions from our clients and we work very hard to identify the best ones for inclusion in our product.  At the current moment we have enough outstanding feature/enhancement requests to keep us busy for the next several years.
<br><br>

We are in the process of formalizing the 2012 roadmap, during this time we will prioritize features that we feel will benefit the Zoovy platform the most.   Any feature submitted for inclusion into the roadmap must be within the scope of the acceptable Zoovy problem domains. (In other words, we aren't taking features for things/services we don't plan to offer).
<br><br>

In order for features to be considered for inclusion onto the roadmap the enhancement/change must  solve a distinct business need for our clients.  Core features should solve problems or offer functionality that will benefit either 80% of our general userbase, or 20% of our top 100 largest clients.  In addition core features must meet other criteria such as being straightforward/user friendly (not overly burdening support), they should be simple to troubleshoot, and the feature/functionality must not be able to cause any harm if accidentally enabled.  The feature must also meet other criteria such as not overly consuming system resources or bandwidth, and/or introducing security risks.  If the feature involves a partner/3rd party technology then that partner/technology must meet additional durability and relationship requirements.
<br><br>

At the moment we have a nearly full 2012 development calendar (from things that were not finished in 2011) â€“ but we would like to understand your request a bit better. 
<br><br>

Can you please take a few moments and explain how these features will improve your sales/generate more revenue or make your staff more productive?   Can you please tell us how you currently (if at all) perform these same functions and why you need additional functionality to perform these.  Approximately how much time per day would this save you and your staff and what is your estimate for opportunity for additional revenue/sales that this would generate. 
<br><br>

Thanks!
<br><br>
