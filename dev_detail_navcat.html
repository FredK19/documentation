<h1>Hacking Navigation Categories</h1>
<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>


Navigation categories (navcats for short) are what make up the site
"pages". Since all sites are really hierarchies which originate off a single
homepage, we felt the category analogy makes more sense.<br>

<h2>Pretty name vs. Safe Name</h2>

Each navcat has a code which is associated with it, the code is a unique
name assigned by the system using letters A-Z and 0-9. The navcat name is
used in the URL for example the navigation category "Gourmet Soda" might have
the navcat name "gourmetsoda". Navcat names are selected by the page
building tool you are using, there is no naming standard. Navcats are always
linked to at the url http://yourname.zoovy.com/category/navcatname
The navcat pretty name is the name displayed to the user for example if the
category was named "HOT DEALS!!!!!" the navcat name would probably be
"hotdeals" whereas the pretty name is "HOT DEALS!!!!!".
When you rename a category only the pretty name is altered, the navcat name
stays the same. This way all older links continue to work.

<h2>Sorting</h2>

Categories are sorted in alphanumeric order by their navcat name, not
their pretty name. This means if you want categories to appear in a certain order
you should think ahead and create categories with names like 1, 2, 3, etc.. Then
rename just rename the categories, the sort order will retain the structure you
originally created.

<h2>Tricks: Indenting</h2>

Using leading underscores you can indent categories thereby creating a
tree effect in your category list. In reality all categories are root level categories,
but customers will not be able to distinguish the difference. Creating indented
categories can significantly improve your sites navigability.

<h2>Tricks: Hidden Categories</h2>

Any pretty name which begins with a exclamation mark (!) will not appear
in any list, but can still be linked to. This is extremely handy for hiding special
promotion categories with coupons or free gifts. Products that are only in hidden
categories will NOT appear in the site search.

<h2>Lists</h2>

Lists are nothing more than categories which do not appear in the navigation tree. Lists can be targeted just like a category,
lists can also be mapped to marketplaces for syndication.
