<article>
<h2>Using the new templates:</h2>

Please follow the steps below to correctly configure NEW (not yet syndicated) products to syndicate using the new templates. These same steps can also be followed to modify any currently syndicated products (recommended). Products syndicated using the old Shoes, Handbags, Sunglasses/Eyewear templates prior to Amazon's deadline (5/31/12) will continue to syndicate without issue. However, we recommend updating your currently syndicated products to the new templates as well, in order to optimally position them on Amazon, and make it easier for shoppers to find them.
