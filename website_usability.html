<h3>Using Headlines / Subheading / Breadcrumb Navigation</h3>
Providing text headings and subheadings can help customers determine what page they are viewing.  Breadcrumbs help customers determine how deep they are in a site.  Providing this info makes it easy to view before and after page.  By showing customers what they are viewing you are making the site more usable, and enabling them to find what they are looking for more effectively.  This also help with search engines, and helping your pages to be easily found and indexed.

They can find your products and purchase them online, but this could help increase email and phone leads.  There will be consumers who prefer to do orders over the phone or email, and without this information visible, you could potentially be missing out.  By making this information visible it makes the site more usable for those customers.  It can also play a role in there confidence in placing orders if the can easily find contact information for the merchant.  It should be consistently located in the same place on every page.

<h3>Product Page Copy</h3>
Your product copy is important for customer usability and search engines.  This includes your text heading and descriptions.  The headlines, copy, message, buttons, calls to action all influence the behavior of the customer.  It determines whether they purchase, create account, move through site, or leave the site altogether.  You should be answering any questions that customers might have for the product or category.  The headlines should simple and direct, and clearly show what a customer will be able to perform on the page.   Use of keywords are important in heading and the entire copy.  Try to use targeted keywords throughout.  Write compelling copy that includes main points or highlights  Use content that can help persuade them to buy the product.
Ex.  Kayak 121D - Model Kayak 121D is great for lake and ocean kayaking.   It is also lightweight for easy transport.

<h3>Pricing/Discounts</h3>
Make sure you are displaying the product price as well as any other cost associated with the products.  Shoppers want to see what their totals are with discounts, shipping, taxes. By allowing this to be seen as they add to the cart it reduces abandonment that would happen if they only say it right before purchasing.  Make sure they are aware of any discounts and can see that in the cart as well.

<h3>Cart Access</h3>
Make sure that the cart is easily accessible and changes can be made easily. Is it difficult to remove an item from the cart.  Have a mini cart ensure that the customer can see the cart content without having to go directly to the cart page.  This increases usablility because they do not have to return to the cart page while still shopping.

<h3>Return Policy
Make sure that your return policy is clearly defined and easily found.  It is advised to be accessible from all pages.  This is important for an online store, since the customer can not physically hold the product before purchasing.  This has a great impact on their decision to purchase.
