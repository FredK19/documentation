<h1>Gift Certificates</h1>

<h2>Notes</h2>

You can create non-taxable incomplete items with a negative price and use them as gift certificates.
This support is currently experimental, and the messaging may be a little strange since the claim page is oriented towards auction sellers, not gift certificate recipients. The "G" (Gift) status in incomplete items is reserved as a gift certificate. You must also have Developer enabled on your account, and you must go into Developer and allow negative priced items in the cart.

It's also worth mentioning that negative priced items are extremely dangerous and
should NEVER be enabled at the same time the soft cart feature is engaged.

<h2>To Create Gift Certificates</h2>

To create the gift certificate you go to orders then incomplete items and
select create new.  Create the item with a negative amount.  Look up the item
in your incomplete list and open it to get the link you can send to your
customer.<br><br>
<!-- 
<b>Sample Email Template</b><br><br>
If you have no other email to send to a recipient of a gift certificate, feel free to use this template as one of your Incomplete Custom Messages. Change the capitalized text (SENDER'S NAME, CLAIM LINK, etc) to the appropriate data for your specific gift certificate:<br><br>

<p>Merry Christmas!</p><p> (SENDER'S NAME) has sent you a gift certificate for %WEBSITE%.</p><p>Please click on the box to redeem your gift!</p><p><a href="(CLAIM LINK)"><img src="http://static.zoovy.com/img/jmiewald/-/G/gift"></a></p><p></p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Your friends at (COMPANY NAME) -->
