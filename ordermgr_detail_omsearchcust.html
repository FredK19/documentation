<h1>Order Manager: Search for Customers</h1>
<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>

Using order manager and the customer tool you can lookup customers, along with their purchase history and account information.

<br>

If you have the CRM Bundle you can also view and add customer notes. Customers notes are shared across all orders for a specific customer. Use this to denote special handling, or virtually any piece of information which should be remembered for a customer (versus just remembering for a specific order)
