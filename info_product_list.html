<h2>Adding products to a list</h2>


<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>By adding products to a list it will not allow a customer to manually navigate to the product but will still render the product searchable by keyword. In addition the product will still display if the correct path for the product is typed in the URL.

This is normally used if you would like to syndicate particular products to a marketplace. This is very helpful when a category has products that you do want to syndicate but also has products that you don't. In this case you wouldn't want to map the category to be syndicated. You would want to create a product list, instead.
