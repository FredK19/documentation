<h2>Installation</h2>

<section>
<h3>AppForge Booster</h3>

Before installing the ZEWC client you must have Appforge Booster+ installed on your Symbol 1846.
Booster is a runtime environment which allows the ZEWC client to interface with the Symbol scanner.
You will need to purchase a copy of the Booster software $25.00, or download a 30 day evaluation copy.<br>
The version needed is the AppForge Booster Plus for the Symbol SPT 1800 (Version 3.5, Build 633 [or better])
Make sure you buy a license for the Symbol SPT1800 version, not just the PalmOS version.
<br>
Once you have installed Booster on your PC, then HotSync your palm pilot and the Booster application should be loaded.
The first time Booster is HotSynced, it can take up to 5 minute to transfer all the necessary libraries.
Once Booster been been successfully installed on the Palm Pilot you should verify that it is registered properly with the
appropriate registration code that you were given by AppForge. You can verify this by going to the Booster application on the
Palm.
<br>
After Booster has been installed - follow the steps below to install the ZEWC software.

<h3>Config File</h3>


The configuration for ZEWC is done via the memo feature of the PalmOS.
PalmOS automatically names a file by whatever appears in the first line.
ZEWC looks for a file which is named "zewc" (without the quotes).<br>
<br>
The format for values are key=value - with each key and value pair on their own line.
The following are a list of properties which can be configured in the memo file.
<table>
	<tr>
		<td><b>KEY</b></td>
		<td><b>VALUE</b></td>
		<td><b>NOTES:</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>ip</td>
		<td>x.x.x.x</td>
		<td>
			Notes: can be either a DNS name, or an ip address of the Zoovy server.
			Using an IP address is preferable to increase speed and reduce network traffic and/or possible errors.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>merchant</td>
		<td>username</td>
		<td>the zoovy username of the store this client will connect to.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>offline</td>
			<td></td>
			<td>sets the scanner to "offline" mode where no wireless network is avaialble, but you still want to scan and store bar codes.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>eof</td>
		<td></td>
		<td>signifies the end of file, any values below this line will be ignored. (it just lets us know that got to the end of the file)</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<h2>Usage</h2>

Along the bottom of the SPT1846 you will see four grey buttons, the outer left and right buttons toggle between modes.
By default the client will assume that it is in an environment with an "always on" wireless network.
A list of modes is given below.
<section>
<h3>Store</h3>

Store simply lets you scan an item, and a location and transmits that data to the server.

</article>
<section>
<h3>Multi-Store</h3>

Multi-store lets you scan one or more items, then a location.
The toggle buttons along the top of the scanner
can be used to move between the fields,
pressing the downward toggle button twice will cause the batch to be submitted.
