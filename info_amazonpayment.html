<h2>Configuring Checkout By Amazon</h2>





 
<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>
Checkout by Amazon (CbA) allows customers to use their Amazon wallet to pay for items in your Zoovy online store.   The service does not require that you have an approved selling account with Amazon, however if you do not have the Amazon feature-set, only a member of the Zoovy Implementation Team will be able to configure this for you. 

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
This feature is now live and ready to use in production.  CBA is very complicated to setup, and not for the technically timid or those lacking in patience. If you do have the Amazon Feature-set and wish to configure this without the assistance of the Implementation Team, be sure to read all the setup instructions before you get started.  We will attempt to document all the obscurities. A video tutorial is also due to be released in the near future.

<h2>Getting Started / Configuring a new account</h2>

<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>
You must follow these steps explicitly to get this configured. If you do not, you will require the assistance of Amazon technical support to "correct" your account which could take several days/weeks.

If you have previously signed up for an Amazon Webstore you CAN still sign up for CBA. This has not always been the case. On the other hand, if you sign up for CBA now, you will be unable to add an Amazon Webstore onto this account in the future.
