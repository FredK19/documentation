In January 2004, Zoovy adopted this pricing model based on feedback from our most successful customers who expressed 
that Live support should be included in the pricing.

<h2>Packages</h2>

Packages are groupings of feature bundles grouped togther for a specific type of business.
Packages include a specialized training manual, and interactive training cd designed for your exact business.
Each package also includes special "industry specific" features.
The industry specific features are only available through the package and cannot be purchased separately.
All of the functionality required to use the industry features is bundled into the package 
(this makes getting started a lot easier since you simply select a package as a starting and grow from there).
<br>
<br>
Zoovy currently offers the following packages:<br>

<br>
If you cannot find a package which suits you, you may purchase the feature bundles individually. 
However packages offer groupings of features at a discounted price - so it is probably smarter to buy the package that is similar to your business.
Any feature bundle can be adde to any package (no matter which package you start with).

<h2>How Final Value Fees Work</h2>

Final Value Fees are simply calculated as 2% of total for an invoice (before shipping and tax).<br>
<br>
For any order entered into the Zoovy system.
For example if you are using Zoovy in a point of sale environment (brick and mortar store) any orders entered through your register would not be considered in the 2% final value fee. 
However any order that pays for an auction item is considered billable.<br>
<br>
You simple pay EITHER the final value fee, or the base fee - whichever is greater.

<h2>Base Fee: Feature Bundles</h2>

REMEMBER: you can add any feature bundles to your account for FREE if your total base fee is less than your 2% final value fee.
In addition if you purchase a package, all of the feature bundles you need to get started are included.<br>

<h2>Base Fee: Disk Space + Products</h2>

Zoovy does not limit the amount of disk space or products you can load into your account.<br>
<br>
There is a $19.95/mo base for each 1000 products, or each 100/mb of disk space you use. <br>
<br>
Remember: there is no charge for products when your total base fee is less than your 2% final value fee.

</article>
<article>
<h2>Base Fee: Bandwidth</h2>

Customers who exceed 10gb of transfer in a given month will be charged a rate of $25 per additional gb. 
Most customers will never even see this charge. Assuming an average page (with images) is 50kb, then 
10gb. equates to approximately 200,000 visitors. Only high volume sites need concern themselves with this.<br>
<br>
Remember: there is never a charge for bandwidth unless you exceed your allocated bandwidth, AND your total base fee is less than your 2% final value fee.

</article>
<article>
<h2>Base Fee: Professional Services / Live Support</h2>

Zoovy breaks questions into two categories: Situation Specific, and Non-Situation Specific. <br>
<br>
<table>
<tr>
	<td valign='top' nowrap><b>Non-Situation Specific</b></td>
	<td valign='top'>covers most topics, and simple questions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td valign='top' nowrap><b>Situation Specific</b></td>
	<td valign='top'>covers anything which pertains directly to a customers website, or specific business configuration, and most advanced questions that cover two or more features are used together.<br></td>
</tr>
</table>
<br>
Zoovy offers free online support for all non-situation specific support.<br>
Zoovy requires customers utilize our Live support for all situation specific questions (which are often too complicated to handle over e-mail anyway).
Live support is available at $80/hr. and can be setup on either a next available callback basis, or in pre-allocated blocks of time.<br>
<i>There is no charge for any issues that is determined to be Zoovys fault (e.g. bugs.)</i><br>

<br>
If an electronic support request is deemed "Situation Specific" the customer will be asked to refer the question to Live support. Of course any  question (no matter how easy or difficult) can be referred to Live support at the customers option.<br>
<br>
Each Package includes a pre-paid block of support time which intended to famiarlize the customer with the system and to answer any 
questions they may have while they are initially coming online. The amount of time varies by the type of package purchased. 
The pre-paid time never expires and can be used at any point in the future. Pre-paid time carries over from month to month, and does not expire.<br>
<br>
Remember: there is no charge for live support provided your total base fees are less than your 2% final value fee.<Br>
<br>
<b>ON MAY 1ST 2005 - ZOOVY WILL BE ANNOUNCING LIVE INBOUND PHONE SUPPORT ALONG WITH LIMITED WEEKEND COVERAGE.</b>
