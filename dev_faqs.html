<h1>Utilities: Frequently Asked Questions</h1>


<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) are supported in Zoovy through our faq engine, which allows your customers to easily search by keyword or topic.  The FAQ element is available on the newer layouts for the 'returns' page.

<h2>How to Create FAQ's</h2>
The first step in creating your faq library is to create a topic.  An example of a topic may be 'shipping' or 'payment' or a specific product id.  Create a few topics first.

<h2>Displaying the faq's on the website</h2>
To display the faq's, you need to select the appropriate layout on your returns page.  Currently, the only layout to support this technology is r-20061003: Policies Page: 3 policies and faq.  Custom Layouts can be used on other pages in your store if you want the faq engine elsewhere.

<h2>FAQ Strategy</h2>

<section>
<h3>Be precise with your question and answer</h3>
Questions should be to the point. This is even more true for answers.  Avoid open ended questions that are going to require a long explanation. If you find yourself writing a long answer, most likely you need to break your question into multiple questions.  A simple 'yes' or 'no' answer is perfectly acceptable and your customers are likely to appreciate the directness.
</section>

<section>
<h3>The keyword in FAQ is 'Frequently'</h3>
Don't use your FAQ as an 'everything you ever wanted to know about my website'.  Keep it limited to the questions you are asked most often. The purpose of an FAQ is to reduce your customer support costs.  If the page is overwhelming, people are less likely to spend time sorting to find the info.
</section>

<section>
<h3>Keep it relevant</h3>
The faq is a place to address customer's questions, not to try to upsell or market to them.  Use the FAQ as it was intended for the highest impact.  Use actual FAQ from your customers, not questions you think they want the answers to.
</section>

<section>
<h3>Update!</h3>
If the FAQ works for your customers, they'll stop asking you the questions on the faq, but will start asking you questions that are not on the faq.  When you are continually asked the same question, update your faq.
</section>


<section>
<h3>Product specific questions</h3>
Avoid product specific questions, as this will likely bloat your faq.  These types of questions should be answered on the product detail page or within a product guide (installation instructions, assembly instructions, etc).
</section>

<section>
<h3>FAQ Manager</h3>
Use our FAQ manager, not a layout that is just a big block of text.  Our FAQ manager will display the topics, questions and answers in a logical format that makes it easy for the customer to find what they are looking for and is also search-able.
