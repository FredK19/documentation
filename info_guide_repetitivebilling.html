<h1>Recurring Billing</h1>
<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>

Businesses often need to setup repetitive billing for things such as subscriptions. 
These need to be billed typically either monthly, daily, or annually. 
Zoovy does not have any standard features specifically designed for customers who are doing repetitive billing.  However, that does not mean it cannot be done, just that it's not a native feature. Furthermore at this time Zoovy has no plans to include native support for allowing a customer to subscribe, de-subscribe, and the associated issues such as pro-rating, and managing effective dates. There are excellent
systems which are already built for handling the complications surrounding periodic billing, and Zoovy provides plenty of ways to import/export data to those applications and services.<br><br>
NOTE: None of the ideas, concepts, etc. below are supported by Zoovy, since we don't officially support periodic billing.  However, they are meant to be a helpful place for you to get started.

<h2>Tip: Manage Accounts using Excel</h2>

Many customers have reported that they have been able to manage the list of customers which need to be billed using Excel. 
For those which want to assign invoice numbers they will go into Setup / Checkout Properties and forward their current order
numbers enough to allocate new order numbers, then simply insert those numbers into the excel spreadsheet for the month,
then import the excel spread sheet as a CSV and create associated order files.<br>
<br>
By creating a new spreadsheet each month, you can easily manage new subscriptions, etc.
