[[SECTION]Zoovy Configuration]
Under Syndication >> Sears
Configure the following <br>
* Sears API User (sears username login)<br> 
* Sears API Password (sears password login)<br>

[[BREAK]]
[[CAUTION]]Zoovy only sends inventory, price, and order information updates send automatic.  All products must be manually added to the Sears Marketplace first[[/CAUTION]]
[[SUBSECTION]Activating Products for Sears]
To have products added to the outgoing inventory and pricing feed, you will need to enable the sears:ts for the products.  All items are turned off by default. This can be done by using csv, product power tool, or under product editor within the syndication section.  Products must be set to <b>(sears:ts 1)</b>. If a product is not enabled, updates will not be sent and any order information will not come down into Zoovy. To disable products from sending you will need to set the value of sears:ts to -1.

[[CAUTION]] Do not enable products with the sears:ts attribute that have not been added to the Sears dashboard first. This will generate an error within Sears and could cause your feed go inactive. [[/CAUTION]]
[[/SUBSECTION]]
[[/SECTION]]
[[SECTION]Required Data]
[[CAUTION] Sears has a list recommended attributes that vary by category. Refer to your categories template for specifics.[[CAUTION]]
These Zoovy attributes required across all Sears categories:
<br>

zoovy:prod_name<br>
zoovy:prod_desc<br>
zoovy:prod_mfgid<br>
zoovy:base_cost<br>
zoovy:base_price<br>
zoovy:prod_mfg<br>
zoovy:pkg_depth<br>
zoovy:pkg_width<br>
zoovy:pkg_height<br>
zoovy:base_weight<br>
%IMGURL=zoovy:prod_image1<br>
[[BREAK]]
Use the product export tool within Zoovy to export this attribute data for your product skus
[[BREAK]]
<a href="https://seller.marketplace.sears.com/SellerPortal/d/help/product_data_definitio
ns.jsp" target="_blank">Sears Product Data Definitions</a>
[[BREAK]]
Sears only allows alphanumeric and hyphens(-) in item ids/skus. Any other character will generate an error within the feed. Zoovy has created a sku conversion, for all products with disallowed characters, called the SAFE SKU. Use the SAFE SKU in place of your normal sku for products with disallowed characters. 
[[/SECTION]]
[[SECTION]Listing Skus with Product Options]

You can use the product export tool to export product options: 

* Under Step number 3 check the ,"Expand product option groups" box. You will be provided SAFE SKUS with the option added to the end; i.e. Z-123ABC-D456.
* Under the syndication tab, you must check the 'Use Safe SKU Algorithm' box under the Sears profile, so Zoovy is compatible.
[[BREAK]]
[[HINT]]Zoovy use the %SAFESKU in the outgoing Sears feed, but convert it back to the original sku when order come down. The %SAFESKU should be used on the Sears category template.
[[/HINT]]

[[/SECTION]]
[[SECTION]Uploading New SKUs into Sears]
Steps:
[[BREAK]]
1. To figure out which Sears category your products will be put into, Log in to
Sears and go to the Products tab>Browse&Edit>Bulk, and click on the "Download
Tag Library" button.<br>
This will open a spreadsheet with the categories you can choose from and
download blank templates from in Sears.
[[BREAK]]
2. Download the blank template for the correct category from Sears. In the same
area in Sears (and just below the Download Tag Library button), you'll see 3
dropdown menus. This is where you input the category and subcategories for the
blank template (for the products you want to put on Sears). 
For example, we put ForTheHome in the first one, Kitchen storage in the second,
and NapkinHolders in the third.<br>
Then click "download template" to download the blank template for the napkin
holder category.
[[BREAK]]
3. Now you will need to export the product info from Zoovy. In Zoovy, go to the
Utilities tab>Product Export, and click on the "Select by Navigation
Categories" button to choose by category (or push the User Provided List button
if you have a list of Skus). Check the correct category and click Save
Selections. [[BREAK]]
In the blank text box, add these headers:

4. When the Zoovy export is done, it will open in your browser as a
spreadsheet. You'll want to click the orange CSV button at the top right to put
it into an excel spreadsheet so that you can control it better. 
[[BREAK]]

5. Take information from the export and put it into the Sears template.[[BREAK]]
Notes:[[BREAK]]
*Change image URLs from /-/ to /W400-H400/ [[BREAK]]
*For cost, use formula =sum(N2-0.99) where N2 is the “Standard Price”, but copy/paste into notepad and copy that and paste it into the Sears template (because Sears can't use formulas)
[[BREAK]]
6.  Upload to Sears. Seller.marketplace.sears.com Products tab> Browse&Edit>Bulk. Go down to Step 3, find the file you saved and upload it. Check back for errors.
