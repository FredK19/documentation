<h2>Issue #160329: SEO Company says "homepage.cgis" is bad</h2>

We are working with an SEO company to help us be better ranked in search engines.  They tell us that the name of our default page (homepage.cgis) is not a good default name for a home page as outlined in their comments below (after my note).

<br>

They are asking if we can create a separate .htm page outside of the normal Zoovy structure that is a copy of our home page, but optimized for search engines.  They would name this something like default.htm or the like.
<br>

I am certain this is not permitted in the zoovy system, but wanted to just ask the question.  Also I don't know what your stance is on the naming of the home page and why the filename "homepage.cgis" was chosen, but if this information is helpful I want you to have it.

<br>

In addition, they are saying that because of our limited ability to affect the code within the template, we cannot get our PageRank high enough to really have much effect.  For example, they want us to put an H1 tag right at the top of the page using some of our keywords, but of course we can't because that's part of the evolution template.  I am guessing that these are things that could be altered if we had a custom design in place.

<br>

Anyway, that is why they are suggesting we have an alternate .htm page outside of the regular home page.  I am certain this isn't a good idea and can't be done, but I am curious about your thoughts on these issues.

From SEO Company:

Your home page name homepage.cgis, is not recognized as a home page and therefore does not receive the added ranking value home pages have over secondary sub-pages.  In general, home pages will rank higher than sub-pages, all other things being equal. A home page is defined as a page name with the root ending in "home.", "index.", or "default." such as "index.htm", "default.asp", or "myhome.html". For example, an ideal URL would be "http://www.mykeyword.com/index.htm."  Your home page name should be pagehome.cgis or a traditional index, default, etc., to get home page ranking credit.

<h2>Resolution</h2>
Our thoughts? Your SEO people are generally making busy work for you. 
They are stating opinion as fact and sending you boilerplate suggestions. 

<br>

Lets start with -- the alternate .htm idea is a very bad idea - it will split your traffic across domains and dilute your site. It could hurt you more than it will help you. 
If the person managing your account really studied the headers we send - they would have already figured out we send all pages as static html to google .. the file extensions in the URL have been ignored by virtually every major search engine for like 10+ years -- it's all about the headers. 

<br>

Also - in the sitemap, and other places - the homepage is referenced as / .. or /index.html NOT referenced as homepage.cgis - and homepage.cgis is explicitly NOT included in the sitemap. I don't even know where they found that -- it's an old legacy url we still provide service for - but it's not actively appearing in any links (unless they are hardcoded) .. either way, it's highly unlikely it's hurting you or doing any sort of damage. 

<br>

Since you are using an AJAX theme - you're pretty much relying on the fact that the google sitemap works, and I'm absolutely certain homepage.cgis doesn't appear in that sitemap file.

<br>


The rest of the stuff they're asking you to do can be done as part of a normal template design - and there are plenty of reasons to go with a custom design,
like the increased conversions due to buyers emotionally identifying with the site.

<br>

Be very careful -  The only SEO folks I've met who know what they're doing work for private companies, they are not freelance and they don't have clients - they have equity in the companies they work for.  (Or contracts which give them equity once they make it a success). Several of our larger customers have people like this on staff and they keep us on our toes. They are not looking for new clients. 

<br>

For the remaining SEO as-a-service companies who are out actively looking for new clients -- you will *never* find an SEO company which says "it's perfect" "you're doing everything right" ..  and you'll rarely find two SEO companies which even independently agree on what the best steps are.   Having been in the e-commerce industry for 8+ years, and been doing Internet stuff for over 17 years -- I personally think they're all snake-oil salesmen.

CONTENT IS KING

Hiring an SEO company is not the best way to iimprove your SEO rankings - it's content. Content is king. I'd take a site with great content which had entirely dynamic URL's that changed everyday, and completely incomprehensible URL's over a site which had the best SEO structure money could buy and crappy content.  Google will *find* a way to index good content - they're very good at that.

To that extent: 
<li> Zoovy has relationships with companies that write articles.
<li> Zoovy has relationships with companies that will solicit bloggers to talk about your site. 
<li> You can also offer reviews on your site -- and even better, offer incentives to encourage customers to write reviews. 
<li> Technical specs (pdf's) from suppliers might also be relevant for you.
