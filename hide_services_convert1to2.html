As you are most likely aware big things are happening here at Zoovy.  
Over the past few months we have greatly increased functionality in some 
core areas and have expanded the number marketplaces that are available to you.

<br>


We have introduced vertical market applications aimed at more closely meeting the needs of auction, 
web, media & apparel sellers and will continue to launch additional vertical applications in 
conjunction with eBay and our other marketplace partners.  
We have also made substantial changes to the format of our databases in order to create 
reporting and research tools to meet your needs.
We have introduced a multi-user version of the Order Manager windows client.

<br>


In order to accomplish these things and to support the needs of major emerging 
marketplaces we have ended the enhancement of our 1.0 product that you are currently using.

<h2>Types of 2.0 Accounts</h2>


2.0 has a different series of features, and a completely different pricing structure, 
unfortunately there is not a one-to-one mapping for functionality so it is difficult to 
say with specificity what is and is not included. 
For this reason we will be individually auditing each account and working with you to 
ensure there is no disruption to your business. 

<br>



Let us explain the highlights of how 2.0 packages are structured we currently offer the following packages: 
<table border=1>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top" nowrap>EBAY Edition</td>
		<td>Generic version of Zoovy focused on eBay sellers, includes all eBay functionality.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top" nowrap>STOREFRONT Edition</td>
		<td>Generic version of zoovy focused on people who do not sell on eBay. </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top" nowrap>MEDIA Edition</td>
		<td>A specialized version of zoovy for people who sell Books, Movies, Music and Games.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top" nowrap>APPAREL & JEWELRY Edition</td>
		<td>A specialized version of zoovy for people who sell clothing, jewerly accessories, and wedding supplies.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

** Both the MEDIA and APPAREL/JEWELRY editions include special functionality which is only available in those packages, 
you do not lose anything by choosing them. Both Media and Apparel cost slightly more than the basic versions. 
However include specialized functionality which makes them well worth the extra price 
provided those are the only types of products you sell.

<h2>2.0 Pricing</h2>

Because all 1.0 accounts come with a website, and also include eBay functionality -- all 
existing customers may not convert to the "eBay Only" version of Zoovy. <br>
<br>
The storefront edition starts at $79/mo. and additional features can be added/removed using an online setup process. 
But certain features such as Product Manager, Website Hosting, eBay Functionality, Cross-Selling, 
and Up-Selling are separate features. <br>

<br>


The pricing scheme under the 2.0 system is vastly different than the 1.0 system. 
Basically you pay your minimum monthly fee plus additional fees for any features, extra products,
and fees for any technical support charges 
OR approximately 2% of your gross sales - whichever is greater. 
Depending on the package you select (STORE,MEDIA,APPAREL/JEWELRY) the monthly rates, 
and percentages vary slightly. 
There are also <i>per-orde</i>r fee caps typically at around $5 (which vary slightly by package type).
Below is a matrix of those packages:
<br>
<table border=1> 
	<tr>
		<td><b>PACKAGE</b></td><td><b>MINIMUM MONTHLY</b></td><td>or <b>% of SALES</b></td><td>or <b>FEE CAP</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>STORE</td>
		<td>$79</td>
		<td>2%</td>
		<td>$5.00</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>MEDIA</td>
		<td>$99</td>
		<td>2.5%</td>
		<td>$3.00</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>APPAREL</td>
		<td>$99</td>
		<td>2.5%</td>
		<td>$3.00</td>
	</tr>
</table><br>
<br>
Every package includes 1,000 products and 100mb of space. 
Each additional 1,000 products and 100mb is $20 added to the MINIMUM MONTHLY price.
<br>
<br>
Product Manager, Cross Selling, Advanced Shipping, and CSV Utilities are 
included in the MEDIA and APPAREL/JEWELRY editions, but must be purchased separately for the STOREFRONT package.<br>
<br>
There is a one-time $100 conversion fee for MEDIA and APPAREL/JEWELRY editions which includes two hours of
pre-paid assistance to ensure your data is converted and is properly configured to use the new features -
depending on the level of customization you have done to your site, this may take more time but is a 
REQUIRED step.<Br>

<br>


FREE SUPPORT - Technical support time is counted towards your minimum monthly fee - 
provided your percentage of gross sales exceeds your monthly minimum fees you will have free access 
to technical support each month. 
This approach allows us to provide a dramatically higher level of customer service and let 
customers get live assistance when they need it. 
Effectively this lets you choose between having lots of features, or free support, or both 
(provided you generate enough in sales).

<h2>Valued Customer Discount</h2>

The pricing schemes we mentioned above are the retail rates - which are intended to illustrate how our 2.0 
pricing plan is structured. To reward our loyal customers we have prepared a discount matrix to reward 
customers who have been on the system more than a year.
The longer you have been on the system the larger your discount. 
<table border=1>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Year Subscribed</b></td>
		<td><b>Discount</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2003</td>
		<td>5% off retail</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2002</td>
		<td>10% off retail</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2001</td>
		<td>15% off retail</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<br>

These discounts will automatically be applied to your final bill - 
regardless if it is based on a final value fee, or a monthly minimum. 
They remain for the lifetime of your account - regardless of which features you purchased.

<br>


We want to stress this is not a required upgrade. 
You're welcome to stay with the current account you have. 
We will not necessarily introduce all new features exclusively for 2.0 either.
If we have a feature which makes the product easier to use, or is an improvement 
on a feature you already have access to 
then we will typically roll that into your current account at no additional charge. 

<br>


The primary reason for announcing this migration is that we will be announcing a major new initiative 
which has been in development for over a year and will only be available to 2.0 customers (and in fact was the 
reason we started building the 2.0 billing system in the first place). 
Unfortunately we cannot give additional details at this time. 

<br>
