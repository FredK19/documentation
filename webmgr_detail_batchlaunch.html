<h2>Usage</h2>

Batch channel launcher is intended to launch large batches of auctions at one time.  To make the most of this tool, you should consider using the product power tool to set your HTML auction templates.

<h2>Select Attributes</h2>
The Select Attributes step is sometimes a little difficult to understand. In this step, you are designating which attributes that you will change with this batch launch. If you have already launched the products that you are selecting and simply want to launch them again in the exact same way you would select only a few attributes to ensure that the values are correct. If you have never launched the products that you have selected you will want to select most attributes to ensure that you have set them successfully.</article>

<h2>Saving to Product Database</h2>

This will save time when you launch the next batch of channels.  All of the data you have chosen to enter as attributes will become part of the product definition.

<h2>Summarize</h2>
It is a good idea to click on the Summarize button before you do a batch launch. This will give you an overview of the attributes that you have just set and allow you to catch any mistakes before the auctions are live on EBay. Only after you are certain that you have built your listings correctly should you click on the "Launch Channels" button.
