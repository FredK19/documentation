<h2>Disk Space &amp; Products</h2>
The disk space and product allocation in your Zoovy store varies by the type of package and pricing revision your account is on.  

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
If you are under 10% of your product or disk space allotment then you will get a charge for $0.01 
on your bill with a warning that you should either delete some products/images or you will be billed the following month.
Provided you come in lower the next month you won't get billed anything other than the $0.01. 

</div>
</aside>


There are no disk space or product limits for any accounts, accounts which exceed the included allocation will be billed the following month. A snapshot of the account usage is taken at the time the bill is generated which occurs either on, or shortly after the billing day associated with the account. Customers are encouraged to cleanup any unused disk space prior to their billing day - no retroactive refunds will be provided for cleanups which have been done after the billing day. 

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
You do not pay any disk space fees provided your base fees are less than your success fee.

<h3>PRICING REVISION 2.0 ACCOUNTS</h3>
Pricing Revision 2.0 (Zoovy "EBAY", "STORE" and other packages) applies to accounts created prior to January 1st, 2007. Under pricing revision 2.0 merchants pay $20.00 per 1,000 products OR 100mb of disk space whichever is greater. The first 1000 products and 100mb are included with all accounts.  
</section>

<section>
<h3>PRICING REVISION 2.1 ACCOUNTS</h3>
Pricing Revision 2.1 (Zoovy "ONE" Package) applies to accounts created after January 1st, 2007. Under pricing revision 2.1 merchants pay $25 per 2,500 SKU's or 1 gb of disk space. The term SKU (Stock Keeping Units) effectively translate into inventory records per product. Zoovy ONE packages include 5,000 SKU's and 2gb of disk space with each account.
</section>

<section>
<h3>Why is Zoovy so expensive for products and disk space?</h3>
UNLIKE many other services Zoovy includes all hosting charges including bandwidth, and most importantly regular backups of critical data as part of our service charge. Customers sites are replicated into multiple geo-redundant data centers, onto both primary and backup servers, and each server contains mirrored RAID (redundant) disks in each storage array, and actually has multiple redundant RAID-Z storage arrays.  Effectively a gigabyte of disk space roughly translates into 50gb of actual server storage space used (across all servers), and nearly 200gb of backup space used.  


<br>
Zoovy charges per product because of the cost of syndicating large data files on a regular basis to sites like Amazon, Yahoo Shopping, etc.  Many e-commerce providers which don't syndicate at all will claim "unlimited products" - this is simply because there is no need to report regular inventory numbers to online shopping sites which incurs a substantial amount of computing overhead. 

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
Customers who have more than 100,000 SKU's should discuss negotiated pricing with their Zoovy sales representative. 

</div>
</aside>


</section>

<section>
<h3>How can I reduce my disk space usage?</h3>
An average order is roughly 3.5k in size - or roughly 40 orders per mb, or roughly 285 orders per mb of disk space. In most accounts Images account for over 90% of the disk space utilized.  

<br>

Zoovy provides the ability to delete or compress orders that are older than 3 years which a customer may request up to once per year - however this is not recommended since keeping online order history is important to many customers. As a company grows this sales data can also be used in a variety of reporting engines and once it is deleted - it is gone - forever. 

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
Customers may request the removal of orders up to once per calendar year for free. 
Currently this must be done by administrators. Customers should allow up to one (1) full billing cycle for this request to be processed.
