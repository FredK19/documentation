<h2>Overview</h2>
This document covers how Zoovy builds the window titlebar for a web page and how you can adjust this display.

<h2>Titlebar/Meta Tag Title</h2>
In Zoovy the window title bar (i.e. title meta tag) for a page is built from a combination of 2 components:
<br>
<li>1. Website Title
<li>2. Page meta title information
<br>
<section>
<h3>Website Title</h3>
This is configured in Setup > Site Builder > Edit Company Info > SEO Title.  This field cannot be blank and is global to your account currently.  While it cannot be blank, you can fill the field with a single "space" character to make it appear blank.<br>
<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>Alternately some people use a more generic, non-store specific message here, something like "Great Deals on" that is filled in with the second half of the title (below).

</div>
</aside>

</section>

<section>
<h3>Page meta title information</h3>
Where this is pulled in from depends somewhat on the type of page being created.  For most pages in the Zoovy system (homepage, contact us, categories) this information is set in the Meta Tags > Page Title area of the web page setup/layout for that particular page.  Rule of thumb is that if you configure the page in Site Builder, this is where you set this information.
<br>
The primary exception to the above is product pages.  While product pages also have a "Meta Tags > Page Title" area, this information is auto-populated from the products name. Changing the information here will result in changing the name for the product.
</section>

So in conjunction these two fields build the web pages window titlebar.  If I have an account called "My Store" and a product called "Widgets", the title for the widget product window would be "My Store Widgets".

<div>Currently the "Website Title" field is global to your account, thus not configurable on a per profile/specialty store basis. As we build our additional specialty store functionality it's possible that we may change the Website Title functionality to allow you to specify this per profile.
