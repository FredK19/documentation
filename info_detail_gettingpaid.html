[[STAFF]]
As of February 29, 2008, Electronic Clearing House, Inc. operates <br>
as a subsidiary of Intuit Inc.<br><br>
On June 26, 2010 ECHO - Electronic Clearing House migrated multiple Zoovy Merchant<br> Accounts to a new data storage facility. This move was unannounced and caused most <br>
if not all credit card transactions to be be denied to those merchants using ECHO. <br> The problem has been resolved. The merchants were forced to change their PIN #'s on <br> the ECHO user interface.<br><br>

Zoovy's take on this incident- <br>

There are very few merchants continuing to use ECHO. We will continue to support <br> their gateway, however the lack of communication to us and or the merchants is not<br> appreciated. We will not recommend their services to our merchants going forward.<br>

[[SECTION]Which payment methods should I accept?]

The simple rule is there is no simple rule. You should only accept payment methods which you are able to accept and process, and that you feel completely comfortable with. Zoovy will let you accept the following payment types:<br>
<li>Visa/Mastercard/Discover/American Express
<li>E-check.net online check processing
<li>PayPal 
<li>Cashiers Check, Money Order, Personal Check, Company Check
<li>Check on Delivery, or Cashiers Check on Delivery
<li>Cash - for customer pickup only

<br>
<br>
[[HINT]]
If your customers are receiving the below error message, you do not have a valid Payment Method selected for this customer's country:<br><br>
  Merchant has not selected any payment methods. Cannot check out.
<br>
<br>
If you do not want to sell to high-risk countries, be sure to select that in your Shipping setup.
[[/HINT]]

[[/SECTION]]
[[SECTION]What form of payment has the least risk?]

If you want to completely eliminate the risk of fraud, then only accept offline payment methods where you receive payment prior to shipping the product. This includes Personal Check, Company Check, and Cashier's Check / Money Order. These methods require that the customer send you payment, and then wait for you to process the payment. You will need to verify when the funds have been received, and then be responsible for shipping the product. If you don't want to be responsible for verifying when funds are received, then only select Cashiers Check / Money Order which are generally as good as cash.
[[/SECTION]]
[[SECTION]Is there any risk free way to accept money online?]

No, however there are a lot of ways to reduce the risk. In our opinion, the most reliable way to accept payment online is probably using TeleCheck electronic check processing in conjuction with Verisign Payment services. Telecheck provides a guaranteed check service which costs about $20 a month plus %2 of the total of the check, along with $1.00 a transaction fee [rates vary with business type, contact Zoovy for a quote], plus you will need a Versign Payment Gateway account which will cost an extra $39.00 a month, with a $99 setup fee. Because of the fees associated with processing, many small merchants decide to use Paypal which we feel is the second most secure way to accept online payment. Paypal is discussed later in this document.
[[/SECTION]]
[[SECTION]Should I accept COD?]

Cash On Delivery, or COD requires that you pay for shipping, and then the shipping company is responsible for collecting payment and returning it to you. If you allow COD then you are guaranteed to receive payment, or to have the shipment returned to you if payment could not be obtained. However in the event payment could not be received, you will still be liable for paying for the shipping. If you don't mind occasionally losing a bit of shipping because the customer didn't have a money order for the right amount made up, then choose COD. 
<br>Check on Delivery basically means that the delivery service will accept a personal and/or company check in lieu of a money order. Unless you have a very select group of customers, which you have pre-approved for company check, then we recommend you do not accept this method of payment.
[[/SECTION]]
[[SECTION]Should I accept Credit Cards?]

That's entirely up to you. Credit cards are the most common way to accept payment over the Internet, but they are not necessarily the most secure or affordable. One common problem associated with Credit Cards is known as a charge back which is where a customer disputes a charge on his or her card. Chargebacks for Internet transactions are extremely difficult to win, in most cases you will lose the funds. Accepting credit cards is by far the most convenient for the customer and will increase the number of orders you get.
[[/SECTION]]
[[SECTION]How can I accept Credit Cards, what is a Merchant Account?]

A merchant account is basically a number which is issued by Visa/Mastercard, American Express, or Discover which tells them to route funds from a person's card to your bank. In the case of Visa/Mastercard the merchant accounts are assigned by an organization called an issuing bank, in the case of American Express or Discover you will receive a merchant account directly from them.
[[/SECTION]]
[[SECTION]How does a Payment Gateway work with my Merchant Account?]

A payment gateway is a monthly service which connects your website to your merchant account. Payment gateways can be as little as $5 a month, to as much as $100 a month depending on the features you need. Zoovy supports several different payment gateways: [[BREAK]]
<li>Authorize.Net, 
<li>Verisign Payment Services, 
<li>Cardservice Linkpoint, 
<li>Skipjack 
<li>Payment Resources International (PRI) - Transaction Central
<li>ECHO - Open Echo

[[SECTION]What is Paypal? Is it right for me?]

Paypal is a micropayment service which provides secure transactions for small dollar items. If your average sale is going to be less than $250 and your transaction rate is less than a thousand transactions a month then Paypal may provide an acceptable alternative to credit cards. Main reasons to use Paypal: No monthly fees, affordable business rates -around %2.2 percent + $0.25 per transaction-, very merchant friendly on chargeback disputes, customers can pay through paypal with a visa or mastercard. Main reasons not to use Paypal: Paypal requires that customers have a Paypal account before they can transfer money, setting up a paypal account can be a frustrating experience and may leave your customers with a bad feeling from the transaction.
[[CAUTION]]We do not currently support PayPal Payment Pro [[/CAUTION]]
[[CAUTION]]PayPal is only available as a payment option for customers with the EBAY flag on their accounts (i.e., the Auction Bundle).[[/CAUTION]][[BREAK]]
