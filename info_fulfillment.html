<h1>Fulfillment Center Checklist / Cookbook</h1>

<article>
<h2>Concept Overview</h2>


The following document is intended as a guide to assist Zoovy in recommending a fulfillment center for our BPP participants.  Zoovy has a variety of companies that we have encountered and worked with. 

<br>

This questionnaire helps us select only the most relevant fulfillment centers which meet our clients needs, and also give us a framework for discussing alternatives. 
<br>

By selecting a "best match" based on your criteria Zoovy will be in a position to help ensure a successful deployment. Not all fulfillment centers are created equal, in fact we haven't found two that are even remotely similar. 

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
Zoovy has existing integrations with several dozen fulfillment centers.  Let us leverage our relationships with these companies to make sure you get the best deal possible.

<h2>Motivation</h2>
What is your primary motivation  / business case for considering to outsource your shipping operations?

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
Common Answers include:<br>
<ul>
<li> Outgrown local warehouse
<li> want to concentrate on marketing efforts
<li> cost savings
<li> improved "ground" delivery times
<li> improved customer service / professionalism
<li> processing specialized inventory line
</ul>

<h2>Products You Sell</h2>
<ul>
<li> Do you intend to operate your own warehouse concurrently?
<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
If you are going to be running your own warehouse, then you will most likely not be looking at "full service" fulfillment providers.  Full service providers are generally more expensive because they also offer services such as photo acquisition, call centers, and a huge array of other managed services for fully outsourced clients. 

</div>
</aside>


<li> Approximately how many unique SKUâ€™s, and what types of products will you be keeping at the fulfillment center?
<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
This will, at some point translate into floor space.  Each fulfillment center seems to have a different way of calculating the floorspace number (making it nearly impossible to accurately compare their pricing).

</div>
</aside>


<li> How do you anticipate your inventory needs changing over the next year?
<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
Obviously - this is just a guess. However if you are planning add new product lines - be sure to make a note here. Zoovy can often convince larger fulfillment partners to offer more competitive pricing, or to accept clients below their normal "minimums" by enticing them with the possibility of future business.  This is especially true when the fulfillment center is already integrated, which means the turn up will be relatively painless. 

</div>
</aside>


<li> How many packages per week do you currently ship?
<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
Be honest, most fulfillment centers will want to see past shipping invoices from FedEx, or UPS before offering you competitive pricing.  If you aren't outsourcing your entire fulfillment, then please let us know how many packages you plan to ship *with them*, AND how many packages you ship overall. 

</div>
</aside>


<li> Will you be sending inventory to the facility via Common Carrier, LTL Freight, Rail or other method?  
<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
If you do not have expertise in shipping freight then just say "HELP" and Zoovy will make sure to recommend companies which can assist you in sending the inventory to them as part of their service. 

</div>

</ul>

<h2>Budget, Geography & &amp; Timeframes:</h2>

<ul>
<li> How soon would you like to have this up and running?  
<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
You really shouldn't start shopping until your 6-8 weeks from making a decision. Unless you are just in the "fact finding" stage and simply want pricing.  Please let us know so we can work with our partners to ensure the correct level of follow through. 





</div>
</aside>


<li> Do you plan to run a pilot? 
<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
Most companies are going to request a 6 month commitment, however this can typically be negotiated down to a 90 day "pilot".

</div>
</aside>

<li> Are there any fixed deadlines we should be aware of?
<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
If your products are seasonal, or you are launching a major media campaign then please let us know when this needs to be up and running.  Usually you should figure at least 4-6 weeks to get this working, although some companies can move faster if necessary. 

</div>
</aside>


<li> What length of contract/commitment would you be comfortable with?
<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
This question should really be: are you be willing to sign a 1 year agreement to get better pricing? 

</div>
</aside>


<li> Are there any specific Geographies you are interested in?
<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
If you plan to concurrently run your own warehouse with the same SKU's, you should probably consider using a fulfillment company which is in a geographically diverse location from you.  If you don't run your own warehouse then you should consider a geographically central warehouse in the mid-west to optimize shipping costs and because land and labor are cheap! 

</div>
</aside>

<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>
There is an annoying tendency among business owners to want to locate the warehouse geographically close to them.  This is an emotionally driven decision, which is not necessarily the best choice.  Plane tickets are cheap.
Don't restrict yourself to an inferior geography without a compelling reason. 
Remember it's all about: Location, Location, Location!

<h2>Special Services Offered/Required</h2>

This is a list of common services offered by various "managed" or "full service" fulfillment centers.  Whereas companies are basically warehouse's attached to freight shipping hubs.  Both serve a purpose, depending on the needs of your business. 

<section>
<h3>Call Center / Customer Service</h3>
This is only available to clients who plan to use "one" company to manage their fulfillment and call center. The fulfillment center get's a list of orders, along with destination address, they have tracking numbers, and a database of what is in stock - so it's only logical they have all the information necessary to provide a call center, live chat, and/or customer service for a company.  

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
In many cases the Call Center operations of a fulfillment center will far surpass the capabilities of dedicated call centers because the equipment, training, supervision, escalation, etc. are configured to deal exclusively with product fulfillment whereas most call centers are primarily answering services or outbound telemarketing, and do very little product customer service. 

</div>
</aside>

</section>

<section>
<h3>Photo Acquisition</h3>
When receiving inventory, several fulfillment companies have impressive photography studios, with professional photography personnel on staff who can take flawless images of both small, medium and large items.  Better pictures consistently translates into more sales.
</section>

<section>
<h3>Return Processing</h3>
Do you want your fulfillment center to also process Return Merchandise Authorization's. This generally goes along with the call center portion, but it can be exclusive of that as well. 
</section>

<section>
<h3>Common Carriers</h3>
Some fulfillment centers want to use your FedEx, or UPS contract, others will want to use their own master accounts (which typically get better rates which they can then mark up a bit and still pass on a savings to you). If you have any particular concerns here about which company is shipping your stuff, then let us know. 
</section>

<section>
<h3>Receiving Processing</h3>
Are your items going to be sent to the warehouse in bulk, or unsorted. Will items need to be broken down, counted, tagged and then put away? Or will the items come palletized with an accurate bill of lading and all items will already have UPC's or other barcoded SKU on them? 
</section>

<section>
<h3>Assembly / Kitting</h3>
Will you be selling kits, or any other type of service which requires assembly of an item or gift basket?  What about the ability to offer gift wrapping? holiday card printing?
</section>

<br>

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
Other services that you might ask for are "bank like" security vaults for high valued items, refrigeration for perishable items, or computerized verification via RFID tagging for increased accuracy.
