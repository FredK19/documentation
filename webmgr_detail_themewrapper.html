<h2>OverView</h2>
Our Content Management System (CMS) uses a theme (also called a site wrapper) to provide a consistent look and feel throughout your entire store. The theme typically consists of the static elements which appear from page to page, including logo, navigation, menus, and the footer.  In Zoovy, the theme also dictates the colors &amp; fonts which will appear throughout your site. Themes allow you to change the look and feel of your entire site at the click of a button.</p>

<h2>Choosing the right theme...</h2>

<p>Choosing the right theme is one of the most important decisions you will make when setting up your store.  The theme communicates to your customer who you are and what type of business you run.  You should pick a theme that corresponds to the way you run your business as well as the type of product you sell and customer you are targeting.</p>

<p>Some of our most popular themes are our Ajax (Web 2.0) themes.  These themes offer advanced feature sets and use a lot of javascript. Evolution, in paticular, is very advanced.  If your demographic is not very technical, you shouldn't choose one of these themes.</p>

<h6></h6>
<div>Some themes, like Evolution, do not support HTML in the text fields of a product (i.e. description). These themes support, as do all zoovy themes, wiki based text.  For additional information on how to format your text in wiki, please read

<h2>How often can I change my theme?</h2>

<p>You can repeat this process as many times or as often as you would like.  Keep in mind, if your customers see a different site everytime they visit, it can be confusing for them and possibly a bad shopping experience.  You should wait 4-6 months before changing your themes (holiday theme changes excluded).</p>

<h2>Can I edit my theme?</h2>
Some themes have editable elements, such as a color chooser, images or menu options that you can turn on or off.

<aside class="cbc">
<h6>'Steps to edit your theme'</h6>
<div>
<li>Login to your account at <a href="http://www.zoovy.com" target="_blank">http://www.zoovy.com</a>.</li>

<h3>Common editable elements in a theme</h3>

<li>Banners/graphics - Click the edit links that let you select an image from your media library.  Typically, right above the banner edit link will be a banner link editor.  Use that to paste in the link of where you want customers to go when they click the banner.</li>

<li>Search catalog - Click edit on the search catalog and you'll be prompted to choose a catalog for the keyword search (for advanced users).</li>

<li>Newsletter Text - Often, the newsletter form is accompanied by an optional piece of text you can use to describe your newsletter. Keep this text short.</li>

<li>Logo - this is pulled in automagically from the company information page</li>

<li>Finder - If your theme has a finder in it, please schedule an appointment with implementation for assistance.  This is a very advanced feature.</li>

<li>Company information - sometimes, your phone number or company address will appear in the theme.  In some cases, this is hard coded (if it's a graphic).  In other cases, it is pulled in automatically from the company information page</li>

<h2>What is a popup theme?</h2>

Some features, like tell a friend and product reviews, use popups so that your customers can fill out forms.  When the popup appears, it is important that it contains the look and feel of your existing store so the customer knows it isn't an advertisement.  Popup themes are designed with no navigation, just your logo, content and perhaps some graphical elements. That way the user's only option is to perform the required action (such as filling out the form) or closing the window.

<h2>Adding javascript to the header</h2>
There are several third party tools out there, such as google and livehelp, that require you to add a piece of javascript to the header of your store so that their integration can work properly.  Zoovy allows you to do this, at your own risk.


<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
<p>It is important to remember to use the right code in the right place, so that you do not break your store.  Adding non-secure code to the Secure code area will cause an SSL error during checkout.  This will cause more abandonements that anything else you can do.  Secure code will call the src from a https:// location.  If you see src="http://..." do NOT add this code into the secure box.  When in doubt, ask your implementation specialist or technical support.</p>

<p>Just like you wouldn't like us making changes without testing before and after, you should test your store before and after adding javascript to your header.  See if anything stops working after making the changes. Go through checkout before and after modifying your header.  If you are experiencing errors, remove the code that you added.</p>

</div>

<aside class="cbc">
<h6>'Steps to enabling third pary code in your header'</h6>
<div>
<li>Login to your account at <a href="http://www.zoovy.com" target="_blank">http://www.zoovy.com</a>.</li>
<li>Click on the Setup tab.</li>
<li>Click on the Choose Theme link.</li>
<li>Click on the Sidebar/Header link on the left under the 'Customize' header.</li>
<li>Add your code to the appropriate header code area, secure or non-secure.</li>
<li>Save your changes.</li>
<li><b>Test your store to see if the changes broke anything.</b></li>

</div>
</aside>


The more third party codes you add to your store, the more likely you are to break something.  Those codes aren't likely to play well together and if you cause a javascript error in one, you'll likely break them all.  It is highly recommended that you use little or no third party scripts if you use any Zoovy Ajax technology.
