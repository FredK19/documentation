<h1>Order Manager Packager</h1>
<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>

The packager feature of Order Manager is designed to easily deploy custom files such as custom emails, 
custom reports, custom invoices, custom packing slips or any other file you can think of to an order manager desktop. 

Packager support is used by Zoovy support to distribute custom work that we have done for you, and
a package maintainer is available to Enterprise clients - it is also heavily used by 3rd parties who integrate with
Zoovy software.
