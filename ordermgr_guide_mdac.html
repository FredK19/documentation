<h1>MDAC Troubleshooting Guide</h1>
<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>

Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) 2.8 contains core Data Access components such as the
Microsoft SQL Server OLE DB provider and ODBC driver. Zoovy Order Manager uses Microsoft Access Runtime Edition
as it's core database in non-enterprise installations. Unfortunately because MDAC is also relied on by numerous
other applications (including Microsofts own applications) Zoovy can provide only limited support.

We have verified that MDAC 2.8 installs correctly on machines with operating systems 98,ME,XP, and 2000
which are freshly installed.<br>
<br>
This document attempts to fix the commonly known MDAC 2.8 issues:<Br>

<li> Order Manager runtime error 5000
<li> cp internal 103003 runtime error (kernel32 general protection fault)
<li> runtime error 6 - buffer overflow
<br>
Unfortunately once you begin receiving these errors - there is no "simple" fix.<br>
<br>

Attention Windows 98/ME Users - we have reason to believe that MDAC 2.8 has
substantial installation and compatibility issues on Windows 98/ME. We recommend you remain with
Order Manager version 4.26 or lower. You may download Order Manager version 4.26
from <a href="http://app1.zoovy.com/biz/downloads/zom_v426.exe">http://app1.zoovy.com/biz/downloads/zom_v426.exe</a>
<b>However - once you have upgraded to 4.28, you will no longer be able to easily downgrade [thanks to Microsoft!]</b>.

Once you have upgraded your system to MDAC 2.8 (which is installed as part of Order Manager 4.28 and higher)
you will not be able to downgrade back to MDAC 2.7sp1.<br>
<br>
You may download MDAC 2.8 directly from Microsoft:
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=6c050fe3-c795-4b7d-b037-185d0506396c&displaylang=en">

We recommend all users who are experiencing difficulty with MDAC download the mdac_typ.exe file to the desktop, then
run the program, this will cause MDAC to install in non-quiet mode and may provide additional insight as to what the
specific problem is. 99% of the customer issues can be fixed by removing any running applications from the startup (or
simply rebooting into safe mode) and then rebooting, and finally running mdac_typ.exe to install (before loading any
other applications) resolves the problem.

<h2>Known Installation Issues - XP/2000</h2>

MDAC 2.8 may not install correctly if you have *ANY* Microsoft applications open.
This includes any applications which you may not be aware of - to disable any microsoft applications we recommend you download
the MDAC file and start your computer in safe mode, or at minimum disable any unnecessary applications  from startup. To do this
go to start button, click on Run, and type "msconfig" into the dialog and press "OK". Go to the startup tab and disable any applications
which are not critical to the operation of the machine. Specifically Microsoft Office Search (MOSearch) is a resource hog which will
also cause MDAC 2.8 to fail on installation.<br>
