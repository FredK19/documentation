<h2>Free Delivery Confirmation</h2>

Order Manager makes it easy to batch print USPS approved delivery confirmation labels for free (you still need postage, but no fee for delivery confirmation).

<h2>IMPORTANT NOTICE:</h2>

It is very important you follow the instructions provided by the postal service, specifically please ensure that all labels are firmly attached to the box, and MUST not be bent, folded, as this will make them unscannable.
In the event the US Postal Services notifies Zoovy that your labels are unscannable, or the data is improperly formatted you may have your access to this feature removed - the best way to ensure compliance is to verify your labels with your local post master.

<h2>Troubleshooting:</h2>

This requires live access to the Internet to be used, if you are not connected it will give a variety of errors depending on the type of Internet connection.
If there are any errors in the label the text error to a file called dcerror.txt in the order manager directory.
To find an already printed label, it will be saved into the dcimages under the order manager directory, the filename will represent the last number on the order (e.g. 2002-04-1234 would be saved in the file 1234.jpg).
