<h2>WAIT!</h2>
Did you fill out your Company Information completely? You should have done this back when you were doing the basic setup of your account but double-check just in case. Go to Setup > Site Builder and Edit your Company Information. If this is not filled out, you are not going to be able to complete the following steps.

<h2>Step 1: Setup Zoovymail</h2>
When you link a domain, you are also affecting the email for that domain. 
<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>It is important that you understand and prepare for what will happen to your email before linking a domain.

A domain entered under Domain Hosting will be available in your Zoovymail account, if you have one. This is the preferred solution. In order to use Zoovymail, go to Setup > Domain Hosting > Zoovymail and enable Zoovymail. See <a class="linkdoc" href="#?doc=50268">Doc 50268</a> for steps to provisioning a Zoovymail account if you need further help with this step.<aside class="hint">

If you have email elsewhere and wish to continue to host your email elsewhere, you will need to get the MX records from your current host. Do this before going forward.

<h2>Step 2: Change your nameservers</h2>
You will next need to go to the company that currently hosts your domain (such as GoDaddy, Network Solutions, etc.) and change the nameservers. The primary nameserver will be "ns.zoovy.com" and the secondary nameserver will be "ns2.zoovy.com"

<h2>Step 3: Link Domain</h2>
Go to Setup > Domain Hosting and click on the Add Domains button. On the following screen, click on the Link button. Enter the domain that you want without the leading "www." For example, if you wanted your domain to be "www.zoovy.com" you would just enter "zoovy.com"

<h2>Step 4: Configure Domain</h2>
Once you have the domain entered, it will appear under Setup > Domain Hosting > Domain Config. You will want to Edit Configuration on your newly purchased domain. Select the appropriate Email and Hosting mode and save.
<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>If you simply want a domain that points to your Zoovy web store, your Email should be "Zoovymail 2.0" and your Domain Mode should be "(DEFAULT) Default Hosting."

<div>If you want to host your email elsewhere, this is when you will enter those MX records that you got in Step 1. You did get your MX records, right?
