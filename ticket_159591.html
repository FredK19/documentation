<h2>Issue #159591: eBay International Shipping Countries not appearing</h2>

I have international customers claiming my ship calculator 
does not tell them the rate. Do I have a setting wrong?
</article>

<article>
<h2>Note from customer</h2>
Its an issue with my international ebay buyers not being able to see a shipping rate.
Which is costing me business daily.
was the initial alert..... check any of my ebay auctions. 
If you change your location to Australia or Ireland etc....cannot see a rate.

<h2>Resolution</h2>

That calculator is an ebay calculator that they control when you setup your profile to use calculated rate shipping methods.  Zoovy doesn't control anything about that calculator.

<br>

That being said, you are correct that for some reason ebay's calculator isn't returning a value for some countries.  Unfortunately I can't tell you why.  You could certainly open a ticket with ebay and try and find out why they cannot return a rate for Australia when using USPS Express Mail International.  Perhaps they have some issue using express mail to certain areas.

<br>

Other than that, your options are as following:
<ol>
<li> you could try to add other international shipping types to your profile to see if this issue is only with USPS Express Intl.
<li> You could add the Zoovy Flash Calculator to your listins so that people could use that rate calculator instead.  Note that this is going to return the rates that a customer would see when checking out from your store.
<li> You could reconfigure your profile to use either zoovy rates, or a flat ratetype instead of calculated

Probably your best bet is #1 and see if an additional shipping type for international will resolve it.

<h2>Customer Follow Up</h2>
How can I implement the Zoovy Flash Calculator?

<h2>Resolution</h2>
Installing the flash calculator was not intended to be a Do it yourself task. 
It's something we normally drop in when we build a custom template.

The documentation is here:

You might look for a more updated/recent auction wizard -- several of those have it built in (it can be enabled by just checking a box)

<br>

You could also look into having a unique custom design  -- they are very affordable using the express option.  You might want to contact sales about that.
