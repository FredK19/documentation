<h2>Advanced Customer Import Guide</h2>

<section>
<h3>Overview</h3>

Please note: This is an advanced feature and requires that you first schedule training before you submit a technical support ticket.  If you are a new Zoovy merchant and wish to use this feature, please schedule training.<br><br>

The Advanced Customer Import is easy to use. Just export your data to a CSV file (ie go to Utilities -> Customer Manager -> List All Customers -> Click on the Excel button), then put the appropriate headings in the first row (called the Header).
Place one attribute in the following format in each column of the header to denote which field you will be saving,
the import process is case sensitive. Also remember that spaces are not allowed between each header column.
<br>
Example CSV File:<br>
<aside class="html">
<h6></h6>
<code>

%EMAIL,bill_full_name,bill_phone,bill_address1,bill_city,bill_state,bill_zip
homer@simpsons.com,"Homer Simpson",555-555-5680,"123 Some Street",Springfield,MG,12345

</code>
</aside>


<br>
The example above would create one customer record for customer Homer Simpson with billing contact information. Yes, we know "MG" is not a state,
but do you know where the Springfield of the Simpson's is?  Bonus question, what does "MG" indicate?

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>


<b>Q: Why can't I change the value for %NEWSLETTER when updating existing customers?</b><br>
A: Because the customer must have chosen to receive email from you, which they can do in their
account management area.  Any email sent without their direct consent would be spam and is strictly
against Zoovy Terms of Service (TOS) as well as all applicable anti-spam laws.<br>
