<h1>Create an Invoice</h1>
<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>

With the Zoovy Order Manager you can easily create invoices from incomplete sales made on portals like eBay or Yahoo Auctions. The functionality of the invoice create feature mirrors that found on the website manager. This feature stemmed from merchants who needed to easily turn incomplete sales to valid orders when their customers decided not to use Zoovy's checkout system.

Click this icon to begin the process. You may also right click an incomplete sale and select Create Invoice from the pop-up box. Lastly, the Create Invoice tool can be accessed from the incomplete order search tool. When an incomplete order is found,  simply click the invoice icon.
