An example of a what a hacker might try, would be something we call "probing the system". What this does is they will create a customer account and try to hide a message inside of a message. In addition they will modify the headers in the hidden message to deliver the message to a different address. Once they have created an account and get a confirmation that the message has been sent they will assume that they can use this domain to send spam of virus to a particular destination or email address. The hacker will usually wait until 11pm at night to create massive accounts and send out mass emails. Normally at a rate of 3 to 4 a second.<br>
The reason that this method is required, is due to the fact that most Internet providers will not allow you to send more then 100 messages a day. As a workaround the hacker will use an outbound web request that is not monitored by any Internet provider.<br>
As a result of this you will see accounts being created for your domain. We will be making changes to how accounts can be created after code lock down. For now you will have to remove the accounts that was created and rest assured that your customers did not get spammed and no emails was delivered from your domain.
