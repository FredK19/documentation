<h2>LotSize on EBay</h2>






There is a feature called "LotSize" which we don't currently support in 
the interface -- because it's only relevant for "wholesale" categories.
The field "ebay:lotsize" in the product controls this.<br>

Item.*LotSize*         int 
<http://developer.ebay.com/devzone/xml/docs/reference/ebay/types/simpleTypes.html#int> 
        Optional         A lot is a set of two or more similar items that must be 
purchased together in a single transaction. A listing can have multiple 
lots (instead of multiple items). When LotSize is specified, the listing 
price reflects the price of each lot (not each item within the lot). In 
this case, Quantity indicates the number of lots being listed, and 
LotSize indicates the number of items in each lot. (If a listing has no 
lots, Quantity indicates the number of separate items being listed.) 
Important: *Lot items can be listed only in lot-enabled categories.* 
GetCategories returns LSD (lot size disabled) with a value of true for 
categories that do not support lots. Not applicable to Half.com. This 
field is ignored when Item.ListingType=Express.
<br>

There's probably 500+ of these little "category-isms" with various eBay 
categories and it just doesn't make sense to build them all into the 
interface -- I plan to address that in 2008 by letting people add custom 
fields directly into the online product editor -- but if you are
already using CSV .. then it's not really a big deal.<br>

You can also add the custom fields into Warehouse Manager using a 
"custom definition."<br>

There *could* be issues when listing a product concurrently in 
wholesale/non-wholesale categories - since our system isn't smart enough 
to figure out when to send the field and when not to send the field (if 
ebay:lotsize is set -- then the field is sent) .. however in 
the past eBay would just ignore it for non-lot size enabled categories.
