<h1>Future Technology Disclaimer (AJAX / Web 2.0 / Custom Cart) Terms and Conditions</h1>

<article>
<h2>Concept Overview</h2>

The intention of this agreement is to inform  a prospective buyer ("Site Operator") of AJAX (Also known as "Web 2.0", "Prototype framework" or "JQuery framework") functionality and the risks involved in the purchase, and to protect Zoovy's investment in it's technology. These policies also apply to other technologies used on the zoovy platform, including any custom development or any customization of our shopping cart.

<h2>License to Use – Not Modify</h2>
As part of an AJAX website design Zoovy provides a perpetual license to the Site Operator to use the AJAX functionality until the Site Operator terminates their relationship with Zoovy. However, Zoovy retains full rights to the source code, inventions, and any other intellectual property from the site. The Site Operator is only provided a license to use, not a license to modify Zoovy's intellectual property.  
Unless implicitly specified in an agreement, Zoovy does not provide access to source code to AJAX / Web 2.0 sites for these reasons:

<ul>
<li> AJAX code is a fusion of design (css/html) and program code (javascript) which are tightly intermingled.
<li>The inherent complexity in the sites dramatically increases the difficulty associated with troubleshooting anything that breaks if changes are made.</li>

<li>Zoovy's AJAX (Prototype/JQuery) enabled elements, the syntax, and calling mechanisms are the intellectual property of Zoovy, which were developed at great time and expense and so a license to modify would be substantially more expensive.</li>

<li>A broken or malfunctioning AJAX website reflects poorly on Zoovy and diminishes the perceived value of our intellectual property by future prospective Site Operators, in addition to potentially hurting the Site Operator's revenue. </li>
</ul>

<h2>API Changes</h2>
As with any emerging technology that will evolve rapidly - Zoovy plans to change and/or deprecate it's AJAX functionality approximately every 2-3 years, and to not maintain compatibility beyond 1 year past deprecation.  For this reason site operators who utilize AJAX API's should expect that they will be required to update to new API releases from time to time.  The costs associated with upgrades shall be performed at the site operators expense, at Zoovy's current (or negotiated) billing rates.

<h2>Future Browser/Release Compatibility</h2>

AJAX Technology presents a very real risk in the stability/compatibility of a website and careful thought should be used before deploying it. 
Events beyond the control of Zoovy, or even within the control of Zoovy may cause AJAX functionality to become incompatible with one or more browsers, or search engines, or other technologies which need to access your site in order to generate revenue. 
Because of the complexity it may not be possible to diagnose or repair problems.
Zoovy may not have sufficient development resources to address problems on a site in a timely manner. Zoovy does not warrant, nor make any promises regarding the long term compatibility of the site.

<br>

If a problem occurs, Zoovy may need to change and/or break the underlying functionality that an AJAX / Web 2.0 site depends on.   If  this happens:
<ul>
<li> Zoovy may not be able to notify the Site Operator in advance.
<li> Zoovy may not fix be able to fix any problems which arise as a result of these changes.If a change occurs in a browser which is rapidly deployed (such as with a security update) Zoovy may not have the resources to address problems  for many months depending on the number of Site Operators affected. 
</ul>

<aside class="caution">

<div>
Zoovy's service level guarantees and compatibility assurances do not apply to AJAX functionality because it is outside of our control.

</aside>


<br>

In the event a site is not working properly Zoovy may advise  the Site Operator to switch their site to a "standard template" temporarily, or indefinitely if a severe problem is discovered and cannot be repaired in a timely fashion.  In this scenario the AJAX functionality would not be available.

<h2>High Risk Endeavor</h2>
Purchasing AJAX or any "future" technology, while it can positively impact the traffic to an online store should always be regarded as a high risk endeavor by the Site Operator. 
<ul>
<li> Site Operator may need to pay additional money, including rush fees to address problems.
<li> Site Operator may need to pay additional money in order to remove the AJAX functionality.
<li> Functionality simply may not be compatible (ex: javascript incompatibility) between multiple application developers or frameworks. 
</ul>
<br>

Currently, AJAX / Web 2.0 functionality represents a minority of sites on the Internet, which means that while any browser update which "breaks the web" would be immediately fixed, any browser update which breaks all or a portion of AJAX sites may be ignored for a long period of time, even indefinitely.   Some AJAX functionality may be considered a security risk by certain browsers or plugins, there is little that can be done to work around those issues, especially in a timely manner. 

<br>

The future is always uncertain, the only assurances the Site Operator has are:
<ul>
<li> Zoovy is a success fee driven company, any changes which impact the Site Operator's business also impact Zoovy's business and revenue from that Site Operator. 
<li> Zoovy reserves the right to do free or low cost patches or updates, and maintain compatibility across software generations at our sole discretion – in the interest of maintaining a long term relationship.
<li> Zoovy will be focused on maintaining a profitable long term relationship with the Site Operator.
</ul>

<h2>To get Started</h2>

Site Operator, and have read and understood the risks associated with incorporating AJAX (also known as "Web 2.0", "JQuery", or "Prototype") functionality into a site design.  In addition they or any agent of their company is ever discussing the ZOOVY AJAX/Web 2.0 technology in either a private or public capacity with a negative perspective specifically in conjunction with the word ZOOVY, that they will acknowledge that "we were informed of all associated risks well in advance of making a purchase," failing to do so may result in Zoovy being granted compensatory damages for libel.  The venue for any disputes between the parties shall be held in the State of California, County of San Diego. If any section of this agreement is found to be unenforceable the remaining provisions shall remain intact. If a dispute regarding this agreement arises the spirit of the agreement will be taken into consideration by the arbiter.
