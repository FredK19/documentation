<h1>Google SiteMap &amp; Webmaster Tools</h1>
<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>








Google SiteMap is a free service provided by Google that allows them to crawl more of your pages. 
You can register for Google Sitemaps at https://www.google.com/webmasters/sitemaps/login

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

Setup is easy. Once you've registered for the Google Sitemaps service then simply add a the domain which you are mapping into the google interface, verify the domain with google, then tell google where to find the sitemap file (which zoovy dynamically generates)so that google can crawl the domain and add your URLs to the site, it's that easy. Zoovy will automatically display all pages, and products to Google so they index your site.

<h2>Verification</h2>

After you've added the domain that you want to index into your google dashboard, Google sitemap requires that you place a meta tag at the top of your header information in the html.  To enable verification:

<aside class="cbc">
<h6>Enabling Meta Verification for Google SiteMap</h6>
<div>
IN GOOGLE:

<li> Choose verification method: Add Meta Tag, this will generate a code snippit, copy this for use below.<br>

<h2>Pointing Google at the Sitemap File</h2>

Now that you have verified your domain, the next step is telling google where to find the sitemap file that zoovy generates dynamically for your site.  Here ate the steps to point google in the right direction:

<aside class="cbc">
<h6>Pointing Google at the Sitemap File</h6>
<div>
IN GOOGLE:
<li> Click on the "Submit a Sitemap" link in the dashboard on the lower right hand corner
<li> Click on "Submit a Sitemap" again and enter in the sitemap url. The path name for most accounts will be,  "sitemap.xml"
<li> Save your entry. Check webmaster tools the following day to verify the sitemap was received.

<h2>Advanced Users</h2>

The Zoovy sitemap engine will NOT display hidden categories (after all, they are hidden). Some more advanced websites make use of hidden categories. 
To work around this you will need to add a sitemap for each hidden category as such:<br>
<br>
http://www.yourdomain.com/category/path.to.category/sitemap.xml<br>
<br>
So if you set up a site map for a specialty site, whose root category is set to a hidden category, that site map would work correctly.
<br><br>
For more assistance with this please contact Zoovy technical support.

<h2>Is it Automatic?</h2>
yes - it is automatic, in fact it's generated whenever it's requested. <br>
<br>
If Google is reporting timeout errors then you need to enable static sitemap file generation for each of your sites. It means changes won't be picked up as quickly, but that the file will be served faster to google and won't timeout.

<br>

to do this go to: Utilities | Static Sitemap

<h2>About Sitemaps</h2>

In 2005, Google launched the Sitemap 0.84 Protocol, using the XML format. Google's XML format was designed for the search engines, allowing them to find the data faster and more efficiently.<br><br>

XML sitemaps are not, as some think, a tool for search engine optimization. It does not affect ranking, but rather it allows search engines to make more accurate rankings and searches. It does this by providing the data that a search engine needs, and putting it one easy to find place.<br><br>

To encourage other search engines to adopt the XML protocol, Google published it under the Attribution/Share Alike Creative Commons license. Afterwards Google announced that Yahoo and Microsoft had agreed to "officially support" the XML protocol which has now been updated to the Sitemap 0.9 protocol and jointly sponsored www.sitemaps.org, a site setup to explain the protocol.<br><br>

The shared recognition of the XML protocol means that website developers no longer need to create different types of sitemaps for the different search engines. They can create one file for submission, and then update it when they have made changes on the site. This is good news for website owners, and an applaudable sign of cooperation between known competitors.
