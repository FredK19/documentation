<h1>Profiles</h1>

<article>
<h2>Concept Overview</h2>
Profiles provide a mechanism for tracking separate company info. Configuration profiles store information such as contact information, about us, returns policy, email messages, and much more. Each profile may have a unique wrapper, pricing schedule, and root category, company logo, etc. You may have an unlimited number of profiles, and you may associate an unlimited number of domains to each profile. Products also reference profiles to load their policy information for transmission to marketplaces.

<h2>Company Profiles</h2>
Profiles can be used to create separate policies for different domains. This means you have the ability to have a different look and feel for each domain. Profiles can also be used so that you can launch to eBay with different policies.

<h2>Managing Profiles</h2>
A profile by itself is mainly used for launching auctions.  However you can also map the profile to one of your domain names so that you can create a Specialty Store.  Specialty Stores let you run multiple stores from one Zoovy account.  Each Specialty Store can have it's own homepage, policies and theme.  
<br>
In order to create a Specialty Store, you must map a domain to a profile.  Use the steps listed above to create a profile. For more information on setting up a domain and mapping it to a specialty store, please visit:
<a class="linkdoc" href="#?doc=50334">Doc 50334</a> A profile will not show up in the site builder until a domain has been mapped to it.
<br>
You have the ability of configuring your Wrapper, Root Category, Pricing Schedule, Company Name, Company Contact Info, Company Policies and Information, and Logo.

There is a known issue with specialty store homepages sharing the product with the homepage of your default profile.  The work around for this is to create a list for the homepage of the specialty store and select that as the source. <a class="linkdoc" href="#?doc=50325|filename">Doc 50325|filename</a> explains what lists are and how to use them.

<h2>Deleting Profile</h2>
Profiles are like the cornerstone of a building, taking them away is rarely necessary, and typically dangerous."
-- Brian Horakh, Zoovy System Architect
<br>
<li>Removing profiles from the system is very dangerous. If the profile is still being referenced by a product or website the removing it can cause a enormously wide range of nasty business impacting issues ranging from minor problems such as missing contact information, to more severe blank emails and blank/corrupt listings, a large briar patch of issues.

<li>It is your responsibility to make sure a profile is NOT in use prior to removing it. At a minimum this means making sure that no products are using the profile, and no domains use the profile, and no listings are live, or scheduled for any marketplace which has been created using this profile.

<li>If you cannot say with absolute certainty that the profile is not in use please do NOT proceed!

<li>Diagnosis of technical issues stemming from deleted profiles can be very difficult and resource intensive. If the removal of a profile is determined to be the cause you will incur additional fees and face possible loss of removal profile priviledges for repeat offenders.

<li>It's also worth mentioning that most profiles consume less than 20k of disk space on your account (so 50 profiles = 1mb of space) so removing them to save space is really silly. If you want to save disk space, try removing images instead!
