<h2>Export Properties</h2>

This will create HTML that may be inserted into any Auction or Channel which will 
override the default settings that were inherited from the product. Normally 
this is used to override fields such as Product Name (by default the External 
Item title is the Auction description), Weight, Taxable status, and Options 
associated with the product. Blank fields will not be included (usually leaving 
product title and weight blank is safe - do not edit unless you have a reason.).

You can use Export Properties to add options and notes to your post auction checkout process.
