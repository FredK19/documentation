<h1>Shipping Insurance</h1>
<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>

Unlike Handling the Shipping Insurance feature allows you to prompt the customer to optionally purchase insurance.
Insurance can be computed in a variety of ways including based on the weight, the total price, the total weight, or 
based on a flat fee per item. Insurance is calculated independently of the shipping method (Zoovy assumes that the shipping
methods being offered do not include insurance)<br>
<br>
The rest of this feature is very self explanatory.
Insurance fees can be in one of the following states:
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>Not Used/Disabled.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Included as part of the shipping total.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr> 
		<td>Displays as it's own line item under shipping.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
In addition you may choose to make insurance either optional or mandatory.

<h2>Optional vs. Mandatory</h2>


If you use the Paypal Instant Payment button on the checout you must have your insurance as mandatory or customers
paying via Paypal will NOT be prompted for insurance. This is not a feature currently supported by Paypal.<br>

<h2>Insurance Mode: Flat Insurance Per Item</h2>

This mode allows you to differentiate between three destination zones: Domestic (50 states), Canada, and International.
You can configure a price for a single item, and an optional surcharge for each additional item - this is the easiest way to go
if all your products are similarly priced because it means you can easily make changes.

<h2>Insurance Mode: Per Product</h2>

This enables a special field in the web based product manager that lets you set a insurance amount per product. 
The insurance rate must be the same for domestic or international (although you can use this method in conjunction with other methods
to add surcharges to international orders)

<h2>Insurance Mode: Weight Based</h2>

This mode allows you to differentiate between three destination zones: Domestic (50 states), Canada, and International.
You may input a table of weights and prices.

<h2>Insurance Mode: Price Based</h2>

Similar to weight based method, the Price Based method allows you to ship to three zones, but the table works from the order subtotal. 
<aside class="hint">

When using price based, be certain to create an "empty cart" rule, which is if the total is $0.00, Insurance is $0.00. If you 
don't add this rule when someone empties the cart the previously quoted insurance amount will still display.

<h2>Insurance Mode: Special Rules</h2>

Using rules you can add special handling fees (or discounts) just like you would for any shipping rate. 
Rules are run at the end of the insurance calculation process once all enabled methods have been summed together.
Using Rules it possible to add a surcharge as a percentage of the insurance total to select destinations.

<h2>Advanced Users</h2>

You can combine multiple insurance methods together to arrive at a composite total. The most common example of this is using the
Flat Insurance per Item in Conjunction with the Per Product insurance mode. 
Since the Per Product mode does not give you the abilty to configure insurance based on a zone you can set a base insurance amount on a per
item basis - and then add a surcharge for Canada or International destinations using the Flat Insurance Per Item.
