<h3>Safe vs Pretty Names</h3>
The "Safe" name is the first name that you give a category. The "Pretty" name is what is shown on your webstore to your customers. You create the Pretty name by using the Rename button under the category after it has been created.

<div>Your categories are ordered by the first name that you gave them.

<h3>Product Finder</h3>
The Product Finder assists you in locating products that you would like to add to a page. The Product Finder is found in various parts of Zoovy, such as the Related Items section.

<aside class="cbc">
<h6>How to add products to a page</h6>

<h3>Lists</h3>
A list is a special kind of category. It is group of products assembled for a specific purpose.
</section>
<section>
<h3>Hidden Categories</h3>
You can make it so that a category does not appear in your online store by renaming it with an exclamation mark in front of its name (for example, "!Holiday Specials").

<h2>Root Level Category vs Product List</h2>
A Root Level Category is a page on your web store. This page can be visible in the primary navigation or hidden so that it can only be accessed through a hyperlink, domain name or banner (as a few examples).<br>
A Product List is constructed just as you would a Root Level Category but no page is created. Lists are groups of products assembled for some special purpose. Some examples might be a list for items that you want to use on a specific marketplace syndication or a list of best sellers that you want to display in a special box on your homepage.

<h2>Homework</h2>
Build your category structure as you would like to see it on your Zoovy webstore. Even if you do not plan to focus on your web store, creating your navigation and placing products in categories will help you better utilize marketplaces such as eBay and Amazon. It is an important step for any Zoovy user.
