<h2>Related Products</h2>
Related products (and Accessories) can be called into pages to show other items that your customers might be interested in.
<br>
To show related products on a product page, you must select a page layout that allows for related products. Most of the newer product layouts (anything after 2006) have this feature present.  To set the related items, open the desired product in the editor and scroll down to the cross selling panel.

<br>

If a layout with related items is selected for an item, but no products have been set, the system will use the homepage products by default.  It was designed this way so that a default list of products could be used for merchants who wanted related items, but didn't want to assign them for every product (at the time, 'lists' were not available).  There is no way to turn off that behavior without a custom product layout,  however there is a workaround:

<aside class="cbc">
<h6>'Disabling homepage products as default for related items'</h6>
<div>
<li>Create a new 'list' of products called something like 'homepage products'.  Instructions on creating a list can be found here: <a class="linkdoc" href="#?doc=50325|filename">Doc 50325|filename</a> </li>
<li>Populate your new list with product that you want to appear on your homepage.</li>
<li>Click setup</li>
<li>Click website builder</li>
<li>Click edit next to the homepage</li>
<li>Click on the 'products' link and remove all the products</li>
<li>Now, click the 'edit' link for the product list</li>
<li>For the source, select the list you  just created.</li>
Now, you have products on your homepage, but system doesn't recognize them as the store default and won't use them on the product pages.

<h2>Best Sellers</h2>
Some page layouts have a product listing box called "Best Sellers", "Recently Added", or something similar. It is often a good idea to use a list with a similar name and associate this list to the product listing box. Then you can add and subtract from this list as needed without going in and modifying every page with a Best Sellers box.
