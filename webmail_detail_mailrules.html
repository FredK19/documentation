<h2>Hints for Zoovy Customers</h2>

<li> Always setup rules/shared folders and important aliases (such as questions@yourdomain.com) 
under your admin account and have the mail automatically put into a folder which is shared
with that employee that way as employees come and go, or even simply leave on vacation
it's easy to give other people access.
