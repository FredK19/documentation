<h2>Receiving Order Info</h2>

First of all it should be mentioned that this feature is designed to receive order information entered into a Yahoo Store. Data does not flow back into the Yahoo database. Zoovy customers must purchase a yahoo store from yahoo to use these features.  Once the Yahoo store is setup, follow the instructions below.

<h2>Yahoo Orders do not automatically post</h2>

<b>Question:</b> When I try to manually post an order the bottom of the page says "Delivery failed" and displays a "Bad Request" page. What is wrong?
<br><br>
<b>Answer:</b> Your password or username specified in the synchronization URL is probably wrong.
If you look closer at the error page you should see "Bad header=" and the error returned by our system.
For example - "order pass is invalid" means your password is invalid.
