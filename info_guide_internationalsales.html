<h2>International Auctions</h2>






 What is the first thing that comes to mind when you think of auctioning your 
items internationally? You may be worried about the money conversion rates, shipping, 
payment, or communicating with the bidders. The positive thing about auctioning 
internationally is that you have the opportunity to bring even more people to 
your Zoovy store. Once your Zoovy store has been setup to accept international 
customers, you can tap into a brand new market at minimal cost.

<h2>Payment</h2>

If you decide to accept international orders, clearly indicate payments in the 
form of money orders, cash, or checks must be in U.S. dollars or your country's 
standard currency. If you fail to state this, you may have to convert the money 
into another form of currency and pay the associated fees. Credit cards like Visa 
and Master Card provide the easiest means of accepting international payments. 
They will convert the customer's currency to your own at no cost to you. You can 
accept wire transfers to have the money directly deposited into your account. 
However, the fee for this service is quite costly.

<h2>International Tax</h2>

When shipping a product to another country, it may be subject to additional taxes. 
For example, certain parts of Europe are subject to VAT or Value Added Tax, which 
may be assessed when a package reaches customs. Legibly complete all of the necessary 
forms to ensure that packages travel through customs as smoothly as possible. 
Specifically, you will need forms 2976-A and 2976-E for most international shipments.

Regardless of what the customer requests - you should never accommodate a winning bidder by marking a package, "gift." This is considered mail and customs fraud and carries a very stiff penalty.

<h2>International Shipping</h2>

Clearly indicate to bidders that international shipping is more costly than domestic 
shipping. If you have already configured your Zoovy store to accept international 
orders, the winning bidder simply goes to your web site and chooses the desired 
form of shipping. The process is streamlined and the rates are automatically calculated 
for the customers.

<h2>High Risk International Countries</h2>

It is up to you to determine your acceptable level of risk. There are certain 
international countries that are designated as high risk countries because of 
civic instability, or high incidents of credit card fraud. <br>
Zoovy periodically updates its list of high risk countries. 
However in general they include countries that the US Postal service will not insure packages to.

You can still ship to high risk countries, however it is recommend you only accept checks and 
money orders and always ensure you have been paid before shipping out a product.

<h2>Foreign currencies</h2>


Zoovy does not officially support foreign language sites. 
Some customers have found it is possible to completely change all messaging throughout Zoovy to foreign languages.
Zoovy is not equipped to support non-US currencies, or to support non-US origin shipping. 
The shipping can be overcome by using the Shipping API. 
Virtually all messaging in the system can be edited by simply creating a custom site wrapper, 
custom site buttons, and changing all checkout messages (with requies the WEB bundle).

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>


In order to allow customers from International destinations to checkout from your 
Zoovy store you need both a shipping method and a payment method enabled for 
International destinations.  Make sure if you want to ship to both low and 
high risk countries to enable the "Anywhere In the World" setting in the 
Setup->Shipping configuration as well as a payment method for "United States and Low and High Risk Countries".
