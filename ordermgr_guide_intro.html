<h2>Overview</h2>

The Zoovy Order Manager brings the power of your Zoovy website right to your desktop.

work, and use this tool to send targeted emails, and print invoices. You 
can even use Order Manager to set up a shipping station and have invoices, packing 
slips and shipping labels printed right where you do your shipping. <br>
