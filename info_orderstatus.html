<h1>Understanding Order Status</h1>

<article>
<h2>New (RECENT) Orders</h2>

When orders are created they are saved in the RECENT folder. While orders are in recent they can be cancelled by customers on the web.

<h2>PENDING and APPROVED</h2>
The statuses Pending, and Approved do not mean anything to Zoovy - they are strictly for your internal use. 
Some people place orders which are waiting for payment to Pending, and orders which have been paid for to Approved so they can be shipped. 


<article>
<h2>COMPLETED</h2>
Once orders are shipped they should be placed in COMPLETED status. Orders in completed status will appear on sales reports, etc.

<article>
<h2>CANCEL</h2>
Once orders are placed into cancel then the inventory which was removed for those orders is added back to the available inventory.

<h2>ARCHIVE</h2>
Aftering finishing your yearly or quarterly taxes you can archive orders to reduce the number of orders displayed on the completed panels.

<h2>BACKORDER</h2>
The backorder tab is only available through the Zoovy Order Manager desktop client. 
It doesn't do anything special, other than give you another status like Pending and Approved which can mean whatever you want them to.

<h2>Incomplete Items</h2>

Incomplete Items are NOT orders, orders have things like shipping and payment information which are not present in an incomplete item. 
If you flag an incomplete item as processed (completed) then it will it will disappear. The only way to find the incomplete item is to use the "show all" link. Processed Incomplete items are normally deleted from the system within 24 hours, unless they are placed on hold. 
You should not manually place incomplete items on hold, instead you should convert them to orders so they can be tracked and processed like orders. 
To convert an incomplete item to an order click the Incomplete button on the Orders tab - 
then check the box next to the incomplete item and finally click the "Create Order" radio button, then press "GO" - fill in all the known information, this will place the incomplete item as on hold until payment information is received. 
Remember that incomplete items are only a transitional phase between being a marketplace listing and a full fledged order.

<h2>Order Status: Archive</h2>

Archiving orders takes them out of the completed status, and hides them. 
This results in less memory consumption, and faster page loads. 
Archiving can also be explained simply as a hidden status, unlike recent, pending, approved, completed, cancelled which are visible statuses.
