<h1>Site Builder</h1>


<article>
<h2>Site Builder Overview</h2>
Using the website builder, you can easily customize pages on your site.  The layout selected detmines whether or not you have text, pictures and/or product lists.

<h2>Page Types</h2>

There are several different page types in the Zoovy system.  Your store will likely have several pages for your categories and products, but there are also page types that your store only has one of, such as home, search, cart, etc.  In the site builder, you can modify each different page.

<aside class="cbc">
<h6>How do I edit a page and/or select a page layout?</h6>
<div>
<li>Log in to your account at www.zoovy.com</li>
<li>Click on the setup tab</li>
<li>Click on the site builder link</li>
<li>Click on the 'edit' link next to the page in question</li>
<li>If you have not edited this page before, you will be prompted to choose a layout. Select any layout (you can change it later).</li>
<li>If you are not prompted to select a layout, you can change the current layout by clicking the 'layout' link at the top of the page</li>

</div>
</aside>


Once the page layout is selected, you will be presented with a variety of 'elements'.  These elements vary based on what page type you are editing, as well as by what layout you selected.  Elements may be an image, text, title, product list or something else.  Each element will be clearly labeled. Click the 'edit' link next to any one of these elements to modify it.

<h2>Elements</h2>

There are several different types of elements in Zoovy.  Some are editable, such as an Image, Text or Animation.  Some elements are for display purposes only, and can not be edited, such as graphical elements in the layout itself.  Some elements, such as a product list, are editable in some layouts, but not in others.
</article>

<article>
<h2>Product Lists</h2>
A Product list element actually has two editable parts, in most cases.  One is the products which display in the list.  Click the 'products' link next to the element and you will be prompted to select what products you want to appear.  The 'edit' link allows you to set properties of the listing style itself.  The options that appear are specific to the layout, so not all options will always appear. The options include:

<section>
<h3>Homepage Products</h3>
The homepage product list link controls your homepage list. This is simply a list of products that can be referenced by various pages in Zoovy. Depending on your homepage layout, this list may not be the list of products that appear on your homepage.
</section>

<section>
<h3>Source</h3>
This is the source of the products to be used.  Could be the default list associated with the page, a custom list, or a smart source (on the cart page).   If the page has multiple product lists present, only one should be set to use the page default, the rest of the product lists should be pointed to a 'list' (product pages excluded, as their source is already set to point to related items or accessories).
</section>

<section>
<h3>Listing style</h3>
This may be forced by the layout, or you may be presented with a list of 12 options to choose from.  If you have the options, look at each and determine which is best for this page or type of product displayed.  The more recently added layouts don't let you choose what the listing style is because they offer functionality or aesthetics newer than those of the original 12.  More often than not, these are the layouts you want to use.
</section>

<section>
<h3># of columns</h3>
The number of columns for the product list.  Most of the newer layouts force this, as the complexity of the listing style doesn't allow the flexibility of letting the columns be adjustable.
</section>

<section>
<h3>Background</h3>
This will determine whether alternating row colors are displayed, or a solid.  The row backgorund color may be forced by the layout to use a single color or alternating.
</section>

<section>
<h3>Show SKU with Product Name</h3>
You can set the SKU to show in the product list before or after the product name, or not at all.  Some listing styles inherently force the SKU to be visible.
</section>

<section>
<h3>Sort Product by</h3>
This sets the sort order for the products in this list.  For categories, it is recommended that you list your product alphabetically so that your customer has an easy way to sort through and find what they're looking for.  The exception to this would be if your category is a breakdown by price.
</section>

<section>
<h3>View Details Link</h3> - Some Layouts will let you determine whether or not the 'view details' link is visible.  In most cases, you want this on.
</section>

<section>
<h3>Checkbox/quantity</h3> - some listing styles actually let you add to the cart from the category page itself.  In those cases, you can prompt the customer with a checkbox or quantity box.  If you customers typically add multiple of 1 item, set to quantity.  Otherwise, leave as checkbox.
</section>

<section>
<h3>Notes</h3> - if you have product notes turned on, this will display the textarea in the product list.  Functional, but not attractive.
</section>

<section>
<h3>Products per page</h3> - this is the multipage feature.  If you have a bunch of products per page, you can set this to any number and when that many product are present, it will display previous/next buttons.  Some layouts force the list to display a specific amount of products and will not let you go over this amount.  Often times, short lists are set to display 'randomly' so that each time the page refreshes, different product is shown.
</section>

<h2>Custom Pages</h2>

To add custom pages such as Testimonials or Links, simply create a category, then select a page layout that
does not include a product list.

</article>

<article>
<h2>Listing Styles</h2>

Often times the default product listing style is a text based list.  Aesthetically, this isn't always the way you want to present your product to your customer. In most cases, you can swith to a different listing style.

<h2>Shopping Cart Page</h2>

There are several layouts in the chooser for the shopping cart page, some of which have a custom cart listing style, which includes thumbnails of the products that are in the cart (and even of the options, if they have an associated image).  The layouts are #3005 and up.
