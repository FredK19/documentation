<h2>Issue #156335: Order Export File for Shipping</h2>

Is it possible to export  "recent" orders to a csv file?  If so, how is that accomplished?

<br>

Truthfully I was hoping to do this via the online order manager.  
All of my skus are prefixed so that I am aware of the distributor.  Example would be WMM prefix indicates the order is for Doba.  

<br>

What I would like to have is the ability to export the order information with sku, customer name and address, and product description.

<h2>Resolution</h2>

This feature is available in Order Manager 6.142 or Integrated Desktop version 7 and higher.

<br>

Simply select one or more orders - then right click and create a "Shipping Export File"

You may also want to look into supply chain as a more efficient way to get orders to select suppliers.
