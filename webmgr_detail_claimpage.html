<h1>Site Builder / Claim Page</h1>
<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>

The claim page is where people are sent to pay for an auction.
By default the claim page will use the page layout of the product that is associated with the incomplete item
but unlike the product page the claim page will display the claim message at the top of the page before the 
page content begins. Configuration of the Claim Page can be found under Setup > Checkout Setup.

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div> The claim page is only displayed (by default) when it is necessary for the customer to choose options on an incomplete item in order to checkout.

<h2>Custom Claim Message</h2>

You can add custom instructions to the claim page by editing the claim page message in Setup / Site Automation.
The claim page message is sort of a special greeting for visitors from auctions.

<h2>Custom Layout</h2>

You can set a custom page flow to be used for the product page through developer settings.
In developer settings you can also disable the output of the claim page message. 
In some cases the claim page message may conflict with layout of the page so in those cases it is recommended
you disable the message, otherwise we recommend you leave the custom message enabled.

<h2>Claim Multi vs. Claim Page</h2>

In the event a customer has won more than one claim, they will automatically be taken to a page which allows
them to add all the items to their cart at the same time. The claim multi page is not configurable at this time,
however it does always display the claim message at the top, regardless of the developer setting.
