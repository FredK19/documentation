<h2>Grouping Overview</h2>





Merchandising can be difficult when dealing with several different marketplace. Grouping provides some solutions to merchandising complications. Grouping will allow individual option choices to appears in searches. For example, if a customer searches for "red bikini" they can find "red bikini" rather than a generic bikini that may have an option to select "red" but the customer will never know without first clicking on it. Grouping allows easier syndication into eBay for merchants who use options. Also, grouping allows you to display multiple options on Amazon, limiting the option choice to which color and size are available and in stock.<br>
