<h1>Auction Seller QuickStart</h1>
<article>
<h2>About this Guide</h2>


This guide is specifically designed to acclimate auction sellers to the Zoovy e-commerce platform. 
This guide does not explain the intricacies of auctions and rather assumes that you are
already familiar with terms such as feedback, fixed price, and buy it now, and therefore we can simply focus on 
the various features of the Zoovy system as they relate to auctions.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>



Zoovy uses products to keep track of auctions because it is an e-commerce system at the core.
In all cases you will create a product first then create your auction ad to launch an auction or channel.  
Each product has basic properties such as title and description, which are used to build an auction description.
If you plan to use the storefront feature of Zoovy, then you should create one product per listing
and you should plan on enabling inventory for each product. 

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>

If you do not plan to use the storefront feature of your Zoovy account, then you will be using products simply as templates. 
Each product can be used to provide a starting point for a specific type of listing. 

</div>
</aside>



There is nothing that prevents you from setting up your Zoovy account one way, then transitioning to another as your business grows. 
In fact, one of the biggest benefits of Zoovy is your ability to customize the account to fit your business.

<h2>Terminology</h2>

There are basic terminology differences between Zoovy and other auction management services 
and understanding those will make finding your way around Zoovy much easier.

<section>
<h3>Marketplace</h3>


Marketplaces are where you sell your products (e.g. eBay, Yahoo Auctions, Amazon Auctions). 
Zoovy calls these marketplaces, because they are not all auction sites.  
Some marketplaces exclusively use fixed price or price comparison and others are shopping portals (e.g. Froogle, Dealtime). 
<a class="link" href="#">Link </a>



</article>
<section>
<h3>Channels</h3>

Channels the Zoovy term for an auction listing. 
Zoovy calls these channels, because they can also apply to fixed price listings.
<a class="link" href="#">Link </a>
</article>
<section>
<h3>Checkout</h3>


Checkout happens when an auction ends and a buyer comes to your store to calculate shipping, 
tax, and provide you with shipping details. 
<a class="link" href="#">Link </a>
</article>
<section>
<h3>Incomplete Items</h3>


Incomplete Items are created when an auction ends. 
Each winner is assigned a unique number that is used to track their specific checkout. 
These unique numbers reserve the auction item so that only the winner of the auction can purchase that item through checkout. 
If an auction winner wins more than one auction, each unique item + winner combination is assigned a number by the system. 
This number is commonly referred to as the "Claim Number", because the checkout link for an item after an auction ends is: 
<br>

http://yourname.zoovy.com/claim/####
<a class="link" href="#">Link </a>



</article>
<section>
<h3>Orders</h3>


Once bidders have gone through checkout, selected a payment method and completed the shipping destination, 
the Incomplete Items are converted into orders. 
Each order is assigned a number such as 2003-05-1234 where 2003 is the year, 05 is the month, and 1234 is a unique number. 
<br>


</article>
<section>
<h3>Products</h3>

Products are unique items which you may or may not have in inventory. Products can be added to your website, or can be used
to create channels. When channels are created, the details such as shipping costs are inherited from the product. Other properties such
as eBay description and starting bid price are stored as part of the product. 

</article>
<section>
<h3>HTML Wizard</h3>



The HTML Wizard is a feature used to create auction templates. The HTML Wizard is a Content Management System (CMS) which can automatically combine details such as the title, description, your shipping policy and your payment policy, 
together with HTML to make it look great. 
The advantage of managing each element separately is that you will not have to edit HTML. 
For example, edit the description, then run the HTML Wizard. 
This will put your description into the HTML for the auction template. 

<br>


If you don't want to use the Zoovy HTML Wizard, you can always create your listings in your favorite HTML Editor and paste them into Zoovy. Each Zoovy store includes several standard HTML auction templates. 
You also have the ability to create your own custom HTML wizard.

<a class="link" href="#">Link </a>

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>

The Auction Seller Edition of Zoovy includes special HTML Wizards. 
Be sure to install the CD which came with your signup package.

<section>
<h3>Windows Clients</h3>

Zoovy provides two desktop windows applications: the Zoovy Order manager and the Zoovy Product Manager.
Unlike a web interface the windows versions offer distinct advantages such as the ability to work offline without waiting for a browser window to refresh.

<br>


The desktop versions also accomplish tasks such as image management or printing which are cumbersome to do through a web browser.
Either application may be downloaded by logging into your account and clicking the Downloads link.
We recommend all customers start with the web interface and migrate to the Windows version after they are familiar with the system.
<a class="link" href="#">Link </a>

</article>
<section>
<h3>Review</h3>

That's it: At this point a lot of sellers ask "why is this terminology so confusing?" 
The answer is really simple: The goal of Zoovy is to provide a consistent and generic interface to virtually any marketplace,
not just auction sites. 
Once you understand how channels work, you will know how to use any new marketplace that comes online. 
It simply takes a little bit of training.  

<br>


If channels can be used for more than just auctions, they sometimes have buttons which don't apply to creating an auction.
If you go hunting for a button labeled "create auction", you'll never find it, because it doesn't exist. 
The benefit is that if you sell antiques and a new antique marketplace comes online, you'll be able to try it out with just a few clicks.

<h2>Tips for Success</h2>
<section>
<h3>Automation is your Friend</h3>


Many other auction systems require that you login and press a button for something to happen. 
At Zoovy, you just tell us how you want it done, and we do it - automatically. 
This means that the system can usually do the work of several employees.
For example sending reminders, applying for fee credits, and numerous other tasks can be done automatically. 
Setting these pieces up takes a bit more planning and time than other event driven systems that require a human to login and press a button. 
However, once you are set up you can accomplish a larger volume of auction sales in much less time. 

</article>
<section>
<h3>Shipping 101: more items + less boxes = more profit</h3>


Everything in Zoovy is a combined order. 
Because of our e-commerce background, we assume that every order will have more than one product.  
In fact, we have many features designed to get people to buy additional items from your storefront. 
If you don't plan on using those features that's fine, but you will have an easier time getting started if you establish a shipping profile.  
A shipping profile means you tell us how you ship your product, what handling fees you have, etc. 
Then, you let the system figure out what the shipping charge is. 
If you want to put in a unique price per auction you're going to find it's a bit more cumbersome than the simpler systems that are limited on how they can combine items. 
<a class="link" href="#">Link </a>

</article>
<section>
<h3>Dont fight the system</h3>

Zoovy has unique ways of doing things. 
So while certain aspects may seem irrelevant to your business, please trust us. 
We've dealt with thousands of sellers and we have thousands of success stories.
We know how to get it done. 
Please remember that as a professional auction seller, 95% of the functionality in the Zoovy system doesn't apply to you, yet.

<br>


The advantage of dealing with a powerful system like Zoovy is that we are able to handle more complex and considerably higher volume order configurations. 
Once you are up and running, you'll be amazed at how much free time you have.
<br>

In fact, our experience tells us that with that extra time, you'll find new ways to grow your business that you may have thought were impossible before Zoovy.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<section>
<h3>Choose a Theme</h3>




<aside class="cbc">
<h6>'Choose a Theme'</h6>
<div>
<ol>
<li> Login to your account at www.zoovy.com with the username and password supplied to you.
<li> Click setup on the toolbar.
<li> Select Theme Chooser.
<li> Use the folders on the left to preview different themes.
</ol>

</div>
</aside>


A theme determines the look and feel for your website and checkout system. 
Since Zoovy is at it's heart a website system, 
you can't really do anything until you've chosen a theme for your website. 
Choosing a theme sets up the checkout pages and you won't be able to launch auctions before you've done that. 


<a class="link" href="#">Link </a>



<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>

Don't spend a lot of time here. 
Most sellers just go to the "most popular" category and select the first one that catches their eye. 
You can easily change your theme at any time in the future. 

</div>
</aside>



</article>
<section>
<h3>Create a Product</h3>

As discussed earlier, you need to create a product before you can create a channel. 
If you plan to sell the same item over and over again, then you will create one product per item.
If the item is a one-of-a-kind, then you will create products as templates to track things like shipping weight.
<a class="link" href="#">Link </a>

<aside class="cbc">
<h6>'Create a Product'</h6>
<div>
<ol>
<li> Click products on the toolbar.
<li> Select Add new Product.
<li> Enter a product title. By default this will also be your auction title.
<li> Enter a product description. This should be a short description of your product NOT your full auction advertisement.
This is just the portion of your auction advertisement that talks about the actual product.
<li> Click Save when you are done.
<li> The page will reload and your product will appear on the left hand menu bar.
</ol>

</div>
</aside>





<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>

Make sure you set the product to taxable.

</div>
</aside>



<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>

If you don't put in a price, then the item cannot be bought from the website.  
You will insert the starting bid price in your auction listing in a few minutes so be patient.

</div>
</aside>



</article>
<section>
<h3>Create an Auction Listing</h3>

From the product editor, scroll down to where it says 
"Create Channel" then follow the click-by-click instructions below.
<a class="link" href="#">Link </a>



<aside class="cbc">
<h6>'Create a Listing'</h6>
<div>
<ol>
<li> Click the create channel button.
<li> Choose your marketplace by clicking on the launch now button.
<li> If you have your own HTML Auction Template you've created in an application such as FrontPage, you can paste that into the HTML Description field. 
<li> If you don't have your own auction template, hit the button that says design and choose an auction template from the list.
<li> Select next to edit the fields for the HTML Wizard.
<li> Fill in the fields then hit save and preview.
<li> After previewing, hit save to channel.
<li> That takes you back into the auction creation tool where you will finish creating your auction.
<li> Start by filling in your starting bid, reserve and/or buy it now prices. 
<li> Continue filling in the form and hit review and launch.
</ol>

</div>
</aside>





<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>

To get started we recommend you omit the shipping details from the eBay Auction and leave shipping set to "See Item Description" 
(which means use the stores shipping.)

If you plan to specify the shipping costs as part of your eBay listing and allow people to pay via Paypal we highly recommend you visit 
http://webdoc.zoovy.com and review the document "eBay/Paypal Checkout" for integration tips.

<h3>Scheduling Listings</h3>

A lot of sellers want to schedule their listings to start at specific times. 
To do this, use the channel scheduler.
<a class="link" href="#">Link </a>

<aside class="cbc">
<h6>'Scheduling a Listing'</h6>
<div>
<ol>
<li> Select the product you want to set up for auction.
<li> Click the create channel button.
<li> Instead of selecting launch now, select schedule.
<li> Choose the date and time.
<li> The check boxes enable those features when checked.
<li> The radio boxes or circles require you to make a choice about how many times you would like to repeat this scheduled listing.
<li> Hit proceed to data entry.
</ol>

</div>
</aside>


Zoovy has a neat feature for eBay sellers called Power Lister. 
The Power Lister can repeatedly list a one-of-a-kind item until it is sold.  
Power Lister can also monitor auction prices and launch additional items when a buy it now occurs
or when the bidding reaches a target price.
Power Lister can maintain a minimum number of items on eBay and select alternate titles for listings 
to increase bidding activity.
<a class="link" href="#">Link </a>


</article>
<section>
<h3>Configure Shipping</h3>

Zoovy categorized shipping policies into four general categories: Domestic, Domestic + Canada, Low Risk, and All Countries. 
The Low Risk lists of countries include most industrialized nations and are based on overall fraud rates and USPS insurance availability. 
You should select the one that matches your tolerance for risk. 
<a class="link" href="#">Link </a>



Once you've launched your first listing, you need to configure the shipping so that when the auction is over, the buyer will be able to checkout. 
Zoovy stores can calculate shipping in a variety of ways including: Multiple-Item Fixed Cost, and Zone based rates from UPS, FedEx and USPS.

<br>


Zoovy stores can also have custom tables based on weight and price and can even query a remote program which computes the shipping price based on your own business logic. 
Quoted rates can be customized using something called Shipping Rules. 
Shipping Rules can modify the shipping rates based on which items or combinations of items are being purchased. 
Most one-of-a-kind auction sellers tend to use either Zone based shipping (e.g. UPS or USPS), or a fixed cost for the first item and an additional cost for each additional item. 

<br>


If you plan to use fixed cost shipping, then you should enable simple-multi-item shipping (which is really nothing more than Fixed Shipping)
After enabling simple multi-item shipping, you should return to the product and enter the shipping prices. 
(The option to enter fixed shipping prices won't appear in the product until you've enabled the shipping method.)
You will be allowed to enter both a first item and second item shipping price. If a person purchases more than one item the 
most expensive first item charge is applied, and the second item charge is applied for all other items thereafter. 

<br>


For example if a customer buys product ABC which has a shipping cost of $10 for the first item, and $5 for each additional item, and also
purchases product DEF which has a first item price of $7 and a second item price of $3 the total shipping would be $13 ($10 for product ABC,
$3 for product DEF.)


<aside class="cbc">
<h6>'Setup Simple Multi Item (Fixed) Shipping'</h6>
<div>
<ol>
<li> Go to Setup.
<li> Select Shipping.
<li> Set your origin zip code and choose your allowed destinations then save.
<li> Select Simple-multi-item shipping.
<li> Now go back to the product and enter the shipping costs.
</ol>

</div>
</aside>


Simple-multi-item shipping requires you to add a fixed shipping price associated with each item.
If you plan to quote UPS rates, you should first configure UPS shipping then go back and configure the weight in the product.
<a class="link" href="#">Link </a>

<aside class="cbc">
<h6>'Setup UPS Shipping'</h6>
<div>
<ol>
<li> Go to setup.
<li> Select shipping.
<li> Set your zip code and choose your shipping destinations then save.
<li> Select UPS online tools, proceed, agreement, account information then proceed with the license agreement.
<li> Choose your rate chart.
<li> Check UPS address validation at checkout if you want to enable this feature.
<li> Select your UPS domestic and international settings/methods and save.
</ol>

</div>
</aside>



The UPS method requires your products have a weight in order to calculate the shipping charges.

<br>


Zoovy can support considerably more complicated shipping techniques such as UPS ground for the domestic 48 states, 
then USPS for Alaska, Hawaii and Canada. Shipping rules can be used to apply surcharges and more. 
To get started quickly, we recommend starting with one of the methods above, continuing on. 
Then going back and changing it later.  


<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>

If a shipping price cannot be determined the buyer is displayed a message which says "Actual Cost to be Determined" for $0.00.  

</div>
</aside>



</article>
<section>
<h3>Configure Tax</h3>

Your Zoovy store can automatically calculate tax for items, 
but first you need to configure the tax rates for your state, and possibly your county. 
<a class="link" href="#">Link </a>


<aside class="cbc">
<h6>'Configure Tax'</h6>
<div>
<ol>
<li> Go to Setup.
<li> Select the Sales tax option on the menu.
<li> Choose the method that applies to you.
<li> Select the state and put in the percentage of sales tax required then save.

</div>
</aside>


<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>

Make sure you leave all products as taxable (which is the default). Tax will not be computed on products that are set as non-taxable. 

</div>
</aside>



</article>
<section>
<h3>Payment Processing</h3>

Just like selecting the risk level for shipping, you can select which payment methods are available for each country. 
For example you can choose to accept credit cards from the US and Canada, and money orders from all other countries. 
<a class="link" href="#">Link </a>

<aside class="cbc">
<h6>'Configure Payment Processing'</h6>
<div>
<ol>
<li> Go to Setup.
<li> Select the Payment option on the menu.
<li> General - go through and choose the payment methods here that you will accept then save.
<li> Credit - enable your credit card processing method here and then save.
<li> Special - enable paypal acceptance here. Choose any other special payment methods you will accept and hit save.
</ol>

</div>
</aside>


If you sell via auctions, you should plan on accepting PayPal. Zoovy integrates with Paypal in two ways, the first is via Zoovy Checkout, 
the second is via the Paypal IPN feature. Zoovy checkout lets buyers use the e-commerce checkout of the Zoovy store to pay for their listings.
The Paypal IPN feature lets eBay buyers bypass the Zoovy system and go directly to Paypal.com to pay for their listings after an auction ends.

<a class="link" href="#">Link </a>

Zoovy Checkout is enabled by default.
At the end of an auction Zoovy will automatically send the winning bidder an email stating that they should use your website
to pay for their auction items. Alternatively impatient buyers may click the "click here for Instant Checkout Link" which is located on any listing
created through Zoovy. The advantage of using the Zoovy checkout is superior handling of multi-item combinations, as well
as improved address validation and the ability to cross-sell and upsell related items. 

<br>


The Paypal IPN allows buyers to send you money via Paypal.com for auction items and then the Zoovy system will attempt to match
which auction that payment is for and automatically create an order # so the order can be managed and tracked online.
The system uses details such as eBay Item #, Payment Amount, and the winning buyers email address in it's correlation.
However the correlation system is not foolproof and so if you decide to take this route you will inevtiably end up creating some orders by hand.
Certain types of auctions such as Dutch, and multi-item fixed price listings are especially problematic (since they have more than one winner) 
and therefore will result in fewer successful match. 


<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>

If you are changing your Zoovy username, do not configure the Paypal IPN or a security warning message will be sent to you and your customer.

</div>
</aside>




Zoovy can accept a variety of merchant accounts and payment gateways. 
Merchant accounts allow you to process Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover cards.
<a class="link" href="#">Link </a>

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>

When selecting a merchant account you must make sure it is compatible with a supported gateway.
Zoovy supports the following gateways: Cardservice, Authorize.Net, Verisign Payflow Pro, ECHO, 
Payment Resources/Transaction Central, SurePay, and Skipjack.

</div>
</aside>



</article>
<section>
<h3>Configure Account Information</h3>

Before you start accepting orders, you need to make sure your account has current contact information. 

<aside class="cbc">
<h6>'Configure Account Information'</h6>
<div>
<ol>
<li> Go to Setup.
<li> Select the Company Information option.
<li> Fill in all information and click save.
</ol>

</div>
</aside>


</article>
<section>
<h3>Configure Checkout Settings</h3>

Typically, there are several behaviors you want to change about how customers will interact with your Zoovy store. 
For example, by default customers will be asked to create an account in your store.
After a sale the customers can login and view order history, add order notes, and get tracking numbers. 
Once a customer has an account they will not be able to checkout without logging in.
If you sell items where customers do not expect to create an account then you may want to disable the account feature.
<a class="link" href="#">Link </a>

<aside class="cbc">
<h6>'Checkout Settings'</h6>
<div>
<ol>
<li> Go to Setup.
<li> Checkout properties. We recommend enabling the following settings:
<li> Print order notes on web generated invoices.
<li> Shipping: Quote using Zip code (required).
<li> Do not store or retrieve payment information.
<li> Disable customer cancellation from order status.
<li> Account Creation: Nice.
<li> Store full information including billing and shipping.
<li> Disable login/password requirement for order status checking.
<li> Suppress display of events to customers.
<li> Require Bill To and Ship To same address (optional).
<li> Order Notes enabled.
<li> Require a phone number (optional).
</ol>

<section>
<h3>Processing Orders</h3>


When a buyer wins an auction, an incomplete item is created and the winner is automatically notified.  
These claims, or incomplete items, will appear in the incomplete tab in the order management section.
<a class="link" href="#">Link </a>

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>

Incomplete items cannot be moved to other statuses such as Pending or Cancelled because they are not orders.
If you want to remove an incomplete item from your system simply, select "Complete without Feedback".

</div>
</aside>



<aside class="cbc">
<h6>'Create sample auction item'</h6>
<div>
<ol>
<li> Go to Orders.
<li> Go to Incomplete.
<li> Click Create New.
<li> Create a fake product, and enter your email address in the customer field.
<li> Go check your email to see what the buyer receives when an auction is over.
</ol>

</div>
</aside>



This would be a great time to do a test checkout by creating a test incomplete item and going through checkout yourself.

</article>
<section>
<h3>Create Order</h3>

If your customers are unwilling to go through checkout after an auction is over, you will need to complete checkout for them. 
You can do this by either following the checkout steps above or simply manually creating an invoice.
<a class="link" href="#">Link </a>

<aside class="cbc">
<h6>'Create Incomplete Items - web version'</h6>
<div>
<ol>
<li> Select the Order tab.
<li> Switch to Incomplete status.
<li> Select Create New from the menu at the bottom of the screen.
<li> Fill in the requested information about the purchase and click save. 
<li> If this is related to an auction item, you can use the auction number for the reference product ID.
<li> You may now manage this as any other incomplete order. 
</ol>

</div>
</aside>


<aside class="cbc">
<h6>'Create Incomplete Items - order manager version'</h6>

<h3>Understanding Order Status</h3>

Zoovy offers 5 statuses which you can use to track orders. The statuses are Recent, Pending, Approved, Completed, Cancelled.
New orders will arrive in the recent status. 
The pending and approved statuses are for you to internally track your orders. 
Most auction sellers put orders that are waiting for payment in pending and orders that have been paid and are ready to ship in approved. 
Once an order has been shipped, they place the order into complete. 

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>

If you have a Gold account, you can create your own custom statuses in the Zoovy Order Manager.

</div>
</aside>



</article>
<section>
<h3>Understanding Payment Status</h3>


You need to be aware that Payment Status is independent of Order Status.
Payment status can be grouped into five possible categories, each of which is assigned a three digit detail code.

<br>


The five payment statuses are Paid, Pending, Denied, Credited/Cancelled, and Review.
All Paid codes start with a 0, such as 001 or 050 (e.g. 001 - 099). 
All Pending codes start with a 1, all Denied start with a 2, all Credited/Cancelled codes start 
with a 3 (e.g. 300 - 399), and all Review codes start with a 4 (e.g. 400-499).
Review is used when a transaction succeeds, 
but is reported as "suspicious" by the payment system. Suspicious is usually an issue such as an
unverified address in PayPal or an address verification (AVS) failure in a gateway.
<a class="link" href="#">Link </a>

<br>

If you want more information on why a transaction failed, just look up the payment code or 
check the order events on the Order / Payment Status page.

<aside class="cbc">
<h6>'Reviewing Payment Status'</h6>
<div>
<ol>
<li> Go to the orders tab.
<li> Click the order number of the order you want to view.
<li> Click the Payment Status button.
</ol>

</div>
</aside>


On the payment status page you will find a link which lets you lookup the payment code and what it means (and 
possibly how to resolve it). You will also find the order events which provide details about the transaction history for a
specific order.
<a class="link" href="#">Link </a>

</article>
<section>
<h3>Sending Reminders</h3>

You can easily send reminders or other messages to your customers using the following Sending Reminders procedure.
<aside class="cbc">
<h6>'Sending Reminders'</h6>
<div>
<ol>
<li> Go to the orders tab.
<li> Select the Incomplete status.
<li> Select one or more items.

<h2>Auction Management</h2>

<h3>Viewing Listings</h3>

You can make changes to a listing that has not been launched using the online channel manager.

eBay Fees are automatically credited to accounts by the eBay-recycling bin. 
The recycling bin takes advantage of eBays "relist one time for free" feature.
The relist one time feature says you can relist an item which does not sell and if it sells the second time then the insertion fees on your first listing are refunded.
When a listing does not sell it is automatically added to the recycling bin.
Eventually when a new listing is created, the Zoovy system transparently relists the old item with the information from the new product.

<h2>Registering a Domain Name</h2>

If you have not already done so, having a domain name is a great way to increase your visibility to buyers and to let them 
know they are dealing with a professional seller. 
Most Zoovy accounts can let you have your own domain name which includes the ability to have email sent to your you@yourdomain.com.

<h3>Customizing Emails</h3>

Before going live, you should review the emails that are sent to customers. 
By default all emails are carbon copied to your support email address. 
The default emails sent to buyers tend to be very generic and can often use customization to reflect your specific policies. 
You can easily send a test message to yourself to see what the final product looks like.
<a class="link" href="#">Link </a>


<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>

When customizing the HTML emails using an HTML editor such as FrontPage or Dreamweaver 
be sure remove the head and body tags in the HTML document as they will break most web based email clients.

Avoid using red and blue colors and messages which contain excessive capitalization.
Several of the heuristic SPAM filters will tag messages with those properties as SPAM and will filter/delete the message.
