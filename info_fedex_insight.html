What is FedEx InSight?
It's a Web-based application that enables you to view the status of your inbound, outbound and third-party shipments without a tracking number. All you need is your account number and/or company name and address. You can see information about the status of your shipments so you can more effectively manage your supply-chain processes. FedEx InSight also proactively notifies you by email, fax or wireless of significant shipment events, such as clearance delays, delivery attempts, releases, consolidated proof of delivery and delivery prealerts.
