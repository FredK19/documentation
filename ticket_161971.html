<h2>Issue #161971: Orders not receiving free shipping promotion</h2>

We had an order placed and the customer did not receive the "Free Shipping" promotion.
We have have a free shipping promo going on and this is the first that had a problem.

<h2>Steps to troubleshoot</h2>
<aside class="cbc">
<h6></h6>
<div>
<li> Looked at order.
<li> Created same order in cart.
<li> Put in Zip code
<li> Saw free shipping method (default), and another option "Shipping $10.99" was also available.

<h2>Resolution</h2>
Right off the bat - there are two ways I think this could have happened:

<br>
1. your shipping promotion does not disable the 10.99 shipping - so the customer can still select it.

<br>
2. if the customer had selected shipping PRIOR to the promotion, and came back and proceeded through checkout (or re-ordered from a previous order that did not have free shipping) then it could also happen.

Remember: If you don't take away the choice (even if it's not the best choice) - it can still be selected.
