<h1>Incomplete Items</h1>
<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>


You do not have to manually email the customer after an auction closes.
After any auction closes an external item is created and an email is sent to the winner.
The external item is assigned a number and a link is sent to the customer in the email
(ex. http://yourname.zoovy.com/claim/1234) allowing only the auction winner to purchase the item.
They can then add the item to the cart just like any other item in your store.
<br>
You can see the external item under Order -> Incomplete in the web interface.
On the right hand side you will see a status column which will tell you whether or
not the customer has visited the website or not to make the purchase.

<h2>What are incomplete items?</h2>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; External Items are effectively "Incomplete Orders", they are a list of things
you have agreed to sell to people, which was negotiated by a marketplace. For example
External items are created automatically when Zoovy closes an auction.
In addition you can manually create special external items as a handy way to give certain customers spiffs,
or discounts on special products.<br>
<br>

<h2>How Incomplete Items Work</h2>


When you create an external item you will be given a unique code which
enables any person with that code to put the external item into their cart
and perform a checkout ONE TIME. If you have 10 customers which need special
discounts, you need to enter 10 external item.<br>
<br>
Each external item is assigned a unique number called it's Claim ID which then be purchased by going
to the url http://yourname.zoovy.com/claim/#### - where #### is the system assigned claim number.
<br>
If you have a customer who does not want to go through checkout you can manually combine multiple
external items using the create order feature of the web based order manager.<br>
<Br>
<Br>
Because of their unique properties (for example different prices) Zoovy
tracks them separately from your store products, and your orders. External items are really nothing
more than a transitional state between a product/channel and an order.

<h2>Possible Status</h2>

<li> [A] Active - nothing has happened to this External item.<br>
<li> [V] Visited - user has accessed external item but did NOT proceed to checkout.<br>
<li> [E] Error - something very bad happened. (Contact support)<br>
<br>
<li> [H] On Hold - waiting for you to acknowledge receipt of payment and then move to [P] Pending. Note: external items
on hold will not expire for 1 year, many sellers use this status for non-paying bidders.<br>
<br>
<li> [P] Pending Processing - when an external item is flagged as paid it is then sent back to the marketplace so the marketplace
can close the transaction on it's end and do any final things necessary such as leave feedback, or follow up with the customer
on how the transaction went. You should consult the marketplace documentation to see how each particular marketplace uses
this state. Once processed by the marketplace the external item will be moved to Completed so it can be removed by the
system.
<br>
<li> [W] Waiting for Marketplace - this occurs when the order has been marked as "Paid", but feedback has not yet been left.  It is usually a short-term transitory status prior to the item being marked as "Completed".
<br>
<li> [C] Completed - this is the end of the external item life cycle, feedback (if any) has been processed. This is the
ending state, when an item is flagged as completed then Zoovy will usually purge it within 24 hours, or during the
next billing cycle (whichever is sooner).<br>
<li> [G] Gift Certificate - reserved type, does not expired.
<br>
<i>No matter which state (except Hold) an external item is in, it will be removed from the system after 60 days of
inactivity have passed.</i><br>

<h2>Whats the difference between created and modified</h2>

Created is the date and time the external item was created, whereas Modified is the last time the external item had a
property (such as state) updated. The expiration is based on the modified time stamp, rather than the created time stamp.<Br>
</article>
<article>
<h2>Avoiding Expiration</h2>

Every 60 days you should go in, flag all soon to expire orders as on hold and then either leave them on hold, or
then move them back to pending, this will reset the modified time stamp and you'll have another 60 days. It's important
to realize that most marketplaces will not refund any fees after 45 days, so you should normally try to finalize all
transactions within 30 days just to be safe.

<h2>How can I delete incomplete items?</h2>

You can DELETE incomplete items by editing  the incomplete item and clicking
the "remove" link. This will remove all traces of the incomplete item from the system.

Instead of removing incomplete items from the system you should probably just
flag them as paid and/or processed. You can either complete w/feedback or complete w/o feedback.
This keeps a log of them in case you need them later for records or other information.

<h2>How can I tell if an item is an incomplete item?</h2>

Incomplete items will appear in orders as #####*SKU where ##### is the system assigned claim number.

<h2>Incomplete Item Retention Schedule & eBay Disputes</h2>


Keep in mind that incomplete items expire based on a counter that starts counting down from the
last modified date, so each time the item is touched/updated/changes status the counter resets, all calculate in # of days.<br><br>

They are:<br><br>

  <ul><li>Waiting for purchase -> 45,
  <li>Waiting for payment -> 45,
  <li>Pending feedback   -> 10,<br><br>
 NOTE: completed items should stick around for 15 days so customers can
return to check order status.<br><br>
  <li>Completed (Feedback Left) -> 15,
  <li>Unpaid warned -> 15,
  <li>Unpaid filed -> 15,
<li>  Error -> 1</ul>


Once we delete the data off the web it still stays in Order Manager indefinitely.
