<h2>Preflight Considerations: VPC</h2>
Using a VPC can be a 


<h2>Single Box Route:</h2>
<ol>
<li>
  Use select the proper AMI for the zone and start the instance.
</li>

<li> 
  Create RDS / Mysql Instance - the primary consumer of disk space will be log files in general 5-10gb should be sufficient for most applications.
we recommend "primary" as your db instance provider, you can make up a username and password, for the rest of this tutorial we will use "awsuser" and "mypassword" as the example.
you should use your anycommerce assigned username for the database name in all caps.
</li>
<li>
  MEMCACHED/ElasticCache - provides a fast in memory database for quick lookups like sessions, and other
  frequently accessed hot objects that never saved to the disk.  (Since carts for example are intended to be 
  persistent they are saved in Dynamo)
  
  For singleone server configurations we recommend running memcached on the EC2 node itself as a service rather than
  using the AWS Elastic Cache interface.  A local version will be faster than accessing ElasticCache over a network.
  Typically only 64 to 128mb of memory is ample for even a very high volume site, the exception to this is when the
  user applications request a lot of 'hot data' (such as search results) to the server.   The primary advantage to 
  using an ElasticCache server from Amazon is it is less expensive to have huge amounts of memory dedicated to elasticcache.
</li>
<li>
  REDIS can be hosted on the single box.  REDIS is used for combined host/persistent storage of objects like carts,
  and also for messaging queues.
</li>
<li>
  ELASTICSEARCH - elastic search provides the backend search for product and order data.

  ElasticCache - if you plan to expand to multiple nodes, or have a very high volume site you can use AWS elastic cache.
