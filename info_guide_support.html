<h2>Phone Support</h2>

Phone support is considered billable time (just like implementation time). 

<br>

Most accounts have pre-paid time, or a monthly allocation of time available. 
If an account exceeds it's allocation of time, it will be automatically billed in the next billing cycle. You can determine your current balance by going into the support area.

<h3>Callback Policies</h3>
Callbacks are done on Monday-Friday between 10am - 5pm PST.
Callbacks are performed on a first come first serve basis. 
Calltimes are automatically rounded up to the nearest 10 minutes, and the minimum billing time for a call is 10 minutes. (After the first 10 minutes, which are free)

<br>

If a contact cannot be made at the first phone number then the second phone number is attempted. If the second attempt fails then the call is canceled and no billing occurs. 
If the reason for the call is later determined to be a "bug" in the Zoovy software then the portion of the call used to discuss the bug is not billable - the exceptions to this are: if the bug is already documented with a work around (check webdoc first), any EXPERIMENTAL features, the bug is unique to your system (e.g. your network, ISP, or custom configuration files).

<section>
<h3>Inbound Call Policies</h3>
The first 10 minutes of an inbound call are considered non-billable. 
After that the call will be billed at standard Zoovy technical support rates. 
If prepaid time is available on an account it will be used to bill any time after the first free 10 minutes.
</section>


<section>
<h3>Implementation Hand-off Policy</h3>
At our technicians discretion, based on current queue activity we may ask customers with 
non-critical/more time consuming issues to receive a call back at a later time. 

<br>

Issues which in our best estimate will take more than 15 minutes to resolve MAY require 
a technician to ask you to setup an implementation appointment. 

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
This policy is intended to provide higher levels of customer satisfaction by ensuring that all members of our technical support team have adequate time to respond to every ticket in the electronic queue each day.

<h3>Call Monitoring / Recording</h3>

Zoovy management monitors support calls for quality assurance. 
If you do not agree to this policy please use the electronic system. Technicians may record calls at their discretion. 
All customers accessing Zoovy Support consent to this policy.
</section>

<section>
<h3>Hold Time</h3>
In the event you ask a technician a question which they can't answer - 
they are instructed to put you on hold and request the answer from a senior technician. 
You will be charged for this hold time. If a senior technician is not available they 
may ask you to either hold, or wait for a callback. If you believe that your question 
will likely be too advanced for a first level technician then we encourage you to 
file an electronic ticket and let us escalate it directly to a senior technician. 
This is your choice - our technicians do their best to always give the most accurate 
answer and often that means checking facts, they will *not* guess unless specifically asked to by you.

<h2>Incidents / Developer Issues</h2>

Unfortunately technicians can only add notes and escalate incidents to developers. 
In many cases incidents which are forwarded to developers for review can take 
days to resolve. Technicians are instructed to attempt to provide a workaround 
whenever possible. You will not reach a developer on an inbound phone support call - 
developers work on a strictly outbound call basis.<br>
<br>
Zoovy is based on a shared code base. Software updates need to go through testing 
and quality assurance before they are put into production. Developers will not 
provide emergency support for issues which are affecting only one customer, 
or a small group of customers. We will do our best to provide a workaround 
and/or stop the affected behavior. 
<br>
</article>

<article>
<h2>Maximum Hold Times</h2>
The maximum hold time is 10 minutes during the day, and 3 minutes after hours. After this your call is treated as overflow and transferred to our answering service. 
Zoovy tracks both abandoned and disconnected calls, however it is extremely difficult to anticipate the call volume on a given day - so we apologize when this happens. 
</article>

<article>
<h2>Voice Mail Policy</h2>
Zoovy does not provide a voice mail box for customers to leave a message. 
Voice mail tickets (based on our past experience) on average take three 
times longer to solve than if the same customer had submitted an 
electronic ticket and requested a callback. This ultimately impacts all 
customers since it impedes our ability to provide the best customer 
service possible.

<br>

In past attempts to utilize voice mail large groups of customers have consistently 
been unable to provide sufficient detail and/or consistently neglect key 
information such as username and/or return phone number. These individuals 
often then believe somebody is addressing their problem when in fact Zoovy 
Support has no idea who they are or how to contact them. This alone eliminates 
voice mail as a viable tool for support - since it provides no guaranteed way 
for us to determine who left the message.
