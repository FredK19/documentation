<h2>Order Notification</h2>

Zoovy sends order notifications via a REST based API.
Two parameters are sent: Method=Order&Contents=[xml order payload]

<br>

The response is un-important, but it must be of content-type text/xml. Anything other than text/xml will result in the order being retransmitted.

<h2>Inventory Download</h2>

Your supplier can be configured for automatic inventory updates.  A Generic download allows you to configure a CSV location and header arrangement to pull up to date inventory counts automatically once a day.

To start, set your Inventory Download Connector to "Generic".  Configuration options will be made available to you at this point.  Considering that you may already have an FTP location set up with your supplier, you will need to provide a secure FTP URL and file name to reference for your inventory information.

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
Formatting for your FTP URL should follow:
ftp://(FTPUsername):(FTPPassword)@ftp.(supplierurl).com/INVENTORYFILE.csv

You can test this by dropping the URL into a browser (Firefox).  It will grant you access to your FTP directory index.

</div>
</aside>


Import Frequency allows you to configure a once a day automatic import, or a manual import.  If you manual import, you will need to click "Start Import" for any and all inventory updates.

<h3>Inventory Header</h3>

The Inventory Header box is necessary for detailing the file you will be importing.  Often a supplier will provide you with a single file that cannot be edited, and will contain product information that you either do not need or do not wish to use.  Use this field to set which columns are to be read, and which are to be ignored.

For example, your supplier file has 6 columns but you only need the SKU, price, and quantity, you can format your header file as:

%SKU,,%COST,,,%QTY

The double commas will ignore the columns in between.
