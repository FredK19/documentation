<h1>Issue #159422: Customer can't see their order in the customer portal / order history</h1>

<article>
<h2>Issue</h2>

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
The order history in the customer portal is what a client see's when they login to a  hosted store.  It displays order history so customers can track their order history. In order for this to work, customers must have an account on the website.

<h2>Resolution</h2>

The customer either created their account after placing the order and/or used a different email address to create their account - so the order is not associated with the account.
