<h2>Order Status</h2>
<section>
<h3>Recent Orders</h3>
All orders appear in the Recent tab first. Think of it as a checklist of things you need to take care of (e.g., ship, collect money, etc).
</section>

<section>
<h3>Completed Orders</h3>
This is where you want most of your orders to end up. It means the order has been paid for and shipped.
</section>

<section>
<h3>Canceled Orders</h3>
This is the other final resting spot for orders. It means that the order will never be paid and never be shipped. Zoovy does not charge you for orders moved to Canceled.

</section>
<section>
<h3>Pending and Approved Orders</h3>
These are two optional statuses for the steps that you take to get an order shipped and paid.
