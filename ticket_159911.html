<h2>Issue #159911: Paypal charge doesnt match order total</h2>

Why is and extra $6 being added to these orders? I'm having to refund the customer every time this happens.

<h2>Resolution</h2>
In your paypal account - you most likely have it configured to automatically add $6 shipping/handling to each transaction.

If you need assistance then schedule some time to a member of our implementation team.

While in the neighborhood you should also consider enabling the Paypal Express Checkout and disable the Paypal Legacy checkout - which offers a dramatically better customer experience.

<h2>Resolution</h2>

I've done some more digging, and it seems that the invoices that are affected are those orders done from our website and paid with paypal. It doesn't seem to be affecting eBay orders.

<h2>Resolution</h2>

At first glance it appears this is because your paypal account is configured to automatically add shipping to all orders.

You need to disable any shipping / tax settings in your paypal account or those will be added to the rates zoovy specifies.

If you need assistance please schedule an appointment with implementation.
