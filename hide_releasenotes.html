<section>

</section>


<section>
<h3>6.062 - released 3/25/07</h3>

<li> Version 6.062 addresses a small issue in version 6.060 that caused an alter to be run continuously over and over (this does not by itself cause any issue, but it's still an undesirable behavior). In addition we spent the day going through a variety of use case scenarios to ensure data integrity, and several improvements were made in that area.

<li> Version 6.062 is also substantially faster than all preceding 6.xxx versions, we did some code optimization for the grid control that should give it the "pep" that was apparently in version 5.156. 
</section>

<section>
<h3>6.060 - released 3/25/07</h3>
<li> Version 6.060 was released and we believe it corrected the problems in version 6.058, however at this point we've developed tools on the server to correct any data problems which may have occurred, if you are running version 6.060 or later and have zero dollar order totals, please contact support. 
</section>

<section>
<h3>6.058 - released 3/25/07</h3>
<li> Version 6.058 was released for 1 hour, in an attempt to hot-fix the issues caused by the order contents problem in version 6.056.  While this partially fixed the problem, it did not entirely fix the problem and some orders remained with $0.00 totals. 
</section>

<section>
<h3>6.056 - released 3/24/07</h3>
<li> Since version 6.052 was an emergency release, it did not go through normal quality assurance procedures. A bug fix to the Enterprise codebase to address a problem with Wholesale Quantity Pricing substantially affected the SOHO client database and prevented any order contents from being saved (thus resulting in $0.00 orders). 
</section>

<section>
<h3>6.052 - released 3/23/07</h3>
<li> Version 6.052 addressed a display problem created in version 6.050 with orders containing the same product with different option combinations.  
Version 6.050 was pulled and customers were forced to upgrade. 
</section>

<section>
<h3>6.050 - released 3/22/07</h3>

Any changes you have made to the text based option descriptions in your products using Order Manager will be reset back to their original state at purchase (this is because previous versions did not correctly edit the options themselves, rather just the summary.) 
If you have edited option descriptions in order manager, you should contact Support for assistance BEFORE UPGRADING. <br>
<br>
EDITING ORDERS WITH OPTIONS ON THE WEB WILL NOT SYNC OR PRINT CORRECTLY IN ORDER MANAGER.
