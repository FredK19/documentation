<h2>Email Manager</h2>

The Zoovy Email Manager displays a list of all emails that are pending and that have been sent.
Pending Emails can be deleted, sent items have already been sent and therefore cannot be deleted because they serve as a permanent record of all customer communications and act as a basis for future communications.

<h2>Email a Customer</h2>

To email a customer individually, highlight the customer and right click your mouse.  Select email customer, then select a default message from the list. Edit the message to suit you, then hit the send button.<br><br> To send
multiple emails, follow the same procedure: highlight multiple orders and select "email customer".  Important: You must enable "email notification" in order for this feature to work.  From the "Email Menu" click on Email

<h2>Automatic Email</h2>

You can set up Order Manager to automatically notify a customer when the order status changes.  Select this option in order manager by clicking Admin > Setup > Email Preferences.  If there is a check mark next to the option, automatic notifications are enabled. For Network version users, this interface can be found in Sync Manager, also at Admin > Setup > Email Preferences.

<h2>Customizing Email Messages</h2>

By default the messages are stored in C:\program files\zoovy\ordermgr\emails\default.
To customize the messages copy one of the messages from the default directory into the
C:\program files\zoovy\ordermgr\emails\custom directory.
To over ride an automatic system message just use the same file name. If the same name exists in both the custom and default directory, the custom version will be used. To create your own custom emails, just save the files into the custom directory - the name of the file will appear as the default message subject.

Messages in the default are overwritten each time you install. To avoid losing your work be sure to save your custom messages in the custom directory to avoid losing your work.

When creating custom email messages, do not use MS Word to create them. MS Word creates XHTML documents which also
contain MS proprietary code. Custom messages must be created in HTML only.  You can use any text or simple HTML
editor to create custom email messages.
