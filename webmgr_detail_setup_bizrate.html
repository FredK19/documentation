[[SECTION]Mapping Categories]


The system will only include products that appear on your website in your Shopzilla feed.
You should map the categories on your website to Shopzilla category numbers by going to Setup | Syndication | Shopzilla | 

Categories tab.
Since Shopzilla category is a required field, if it is not specified for a product then the product will be excluded from the 

feed.

[[HINT]]

You can override the default category for a product by setting the "bizrate:category" attribute in your product.
[[/HINT]]
[[CAUTION]]
Shopzilla does not check inventory, therefore products that are sent up in the feed that are out of stock will not be removed from Shopzilla.  To remove products from a feed please set the bizrate:ts to -1.
[[/CAUTION]]

[[SECTION]Debugging]

Once a copy of the uploaded file "DEFAULT-BZR--data.txt" (http://static.zoovy.com/merchant/yourusername/DEFAULT-BZR--data.txt) 

appears in your public files directory - you can use this to see what products
are being included and sent to Shopzilla. If you have any questions please use the User Comment form below.
<br>
<br>
The "Manufacturer" will default to the zoovy:prod_mfg, then zoovy:prod_mfgid, then to product sku if the field zoovy:prod_mfg is 

not set. 
The condition field is controlled by the "zoovy:prod_condition" field, we recommend you set this field to "New" if you know how.
Typically people will use the Shopzilla specifics in the product editor to do this, or a CSV file to do this.
