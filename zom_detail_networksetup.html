<h1>Order Manager - NETWORK</h1>
<article>
<h2>NETWORK Overview</h2>

With the NETWORK bundle, the Zoovy Order Manager can be installed on multiple computers and all stations may utilize a common database. There are two ways to get multiple user support: Multi-User Network, and Enterprise.

<br>

NETWORK allows the Order Manager database to be installed on a shared network drive and then be accessed by multiple installations of the software. A single workstation is designated as the primary station, the primary station is the one which is allowed to synchronize and make changes to the company configuration. Additional stations can be used by customer service personnel, but those personnel should not synchronize.

<article>
<h2>Considerations</h2>

The station with sync manager is the only station which that needs to sync, the client machines do not need to sync as they will read the database from the syncing machine. 
At this time you cannot switch which station is considered the primary (we plan to support this in a future build).
If you are operating the primary station - you should not synchronize while people are logged in to the database, doing so could cause corruption.
