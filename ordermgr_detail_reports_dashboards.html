<h1>Reports - Dashboards</h1>
<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>

Dashboard reports summarize data and display trends in an easy to understand format.
Currently only one dashboard is available, however many more are planned in future releases.
Even the single sales dashboard, combined with the filters can produce some incredibly powerful data to
help you analyze your business and make better decisions.

<h2>Using Filters</h2>

Filters allow you to select which data will appear on the reports. Using filters you can display
the same dashboards but only include certain fields such as sales from new customers, or only sales that
include ebay products, or multi-item sales. For more information on using filters refer to the filters
section of the reports documentation.
