<h2>Issue #161974: Google Checkout and preventing multiple emails.</h2>


We are in the process of implementing google checkout for our website sales.  In testing this system I notice TWO order confirmations are sent to the customer.  One from Zoovy, and one from Google.   The google checkout Terms of Service mentions the following.

"f. Do not send order confirmation emails
To provide a consistent shopping experience, Google will send order confirmation emails to buyers making purchases with Google Checkout. We strongly recommend that you reduce the number of redundant emails your buyers receive by not sending your own order confirmation emails."

Question:  Is there a way to stop the duplicate order confirmation from Zoovy when a customer uses Google Checkout as the payment method?   Other than that, we are ready to implement it.

<h2>Resolution</h2>

We covered this with Google during our integration and wasn't an issue.

<br>

Because Zoovy creates client accounts and our messages are customizable to include additional info that Google's isn't - we aren't subject to that rule.
