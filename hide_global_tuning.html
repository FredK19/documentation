Global tuning adds additional handling fees based on the weight of a product.  Specifically Global Tuning is used to make final additions or subtractions to price that are applied to all available shipping methods. Global tuning is normally used to calculate additional handling fees, or other preferences which should be applied to all shipping methods. Global preferences are applied after the rules based shipping calculation. Global tuning allows two tables to be configured one for domestic, and one for international.

<h2>Configuring Global Tuning</h2>


Global tuning adds handling fees based on weight range within the specified value.  For example, for orders up to 16 ounces we add $5.00.  Keep in mind that anything over this value of 16 ounces will not add a handling fee.
