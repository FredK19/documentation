<h1>Recipe: Handling Pre-orders</h1>

<article>
<h2>Concept Overview</h2>



This document discusses how to handle "pre-orders" within the ZOovy product, which are orders that contain one or more items that are not yet available for shipping.  
Usually this is due to it not being released by the manufacturer, which is different than an item not being available because inventory wasn't here.
