New version of the HTML Editor<br>
   We have introduced a new version of our online HTML Editor that includes a number of enhancements including the ability to strip<br> Microsoft word markup tags. <br>
When using the HTML Editor and you see bogus character like this for example " Â " showing up on your web pages.  The Html Editor Toolbar has a little icon of a Microsoft Word "W" character, which will strip all bogus characters. <br>
