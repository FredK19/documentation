<h2>What is Endicia?</h2>

<section>
<h3>Overview</h3>
Endicia is a 3rd party application which allows you to print USPS Postage.
More information is available at http://www.endicia.com and costs approximately $16/mo. 
Endicia does not mark up the USPS Postage, or charge a fee for "recharging" your account.
Of all other methods for printing postage, Endicia is much better suited for the high volume customers Zoovy is known for.

Zoovy provides the ability to export orders directly to Endicia in order to print postage. 
No cutting and pasting between applications, or re-entering data is necessary.

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div> Endicia 4 x 6 labels are supported for both USPS and FedEx. They can be purchased from http://www.endicia.com/Store/Detail/?ID=417

<h3>Instantly Print Airbills</h3>

Simply right click on one or more invoices in the Zoovy Order Manager and say "Export to Endicia".
Select the type of postage, and the Endicia application is automatically loaded. 
Automatically prints your address label + postage using any desktop inkjet/laser printer, 
or make your labels look really professional by using a thermal label printer - it's that easy!
</section>
<section>
<h3>Stealth Postage</h3>

Many sellers who ship with the USPS do so because it's the cheapest way to ship a package. 
One of the most common reasons for buyer dis-satisfaction and negative feedback on eBay is buyers who feel they were overcharged on shipping.
This is because when shipping via the post office the amount you paid for postage is always displayed clearly on the box. 
Typically the buyer sees that they overpaid on shipping BEFORE THEY EVEN OPEN THE PACKAGE - and needless to say it does not leave a favorable impression.
Stealth postage lets you print valid USPS Postage, without a price on it. 

</section>
<section>
<h3>Free Delivery Confirmation</h3>

Endicia offers free delivery confirmation for priority mail postage.

</section>
<section>
<h3>Automatically Imports Tracking Numbers</h3>

The Zoovy Order Manager will automatically import the priority mail tracking numbers.
As part of the import the order will be automatically moved from the "Approved" status to the "Completed" status and an 
email will be dispatched to the customer with the delivery confirmation tracking numbers.

</section>
<section>
<h3>Custom Label Designs</h3>

The Endicia Dazzle Designer product lets you create custom mailing label designs to fit a custom label or package size. The program can be downloaded at no additional cost to you with an Endicia account.

Endicia has lots of cool features, but the most popular is by far Stealth Postage. 
Stealth postage lets you print real USPS postage which does not show the amount (so your customers don't know what you paid to ship it!).

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<b>Q: Postage Does not Print as Stealth</b><br>

<b>A:</b> Make sure you have stealth postage checked in your custom layout. If all else fails, try using one of the standard layouts and see if that works. Zoovy absolutely supports Stealth Postage, so try starting with a known working configuration and re-adding your customization back in.<br>

<br>

To enable stealth mode for particular layout:<br>

<ol><li>Run the Endicia Dazzle software

<li>Open the layout that you are using for Zoovy

<li>Go to Postage -> Options

<li>Click on Premium Service Options

<li>Check Use Key Line (Stealth) Indicia and hit okay

<li>Go to File -> Save Layout and  save layout

<li> In Order Manager, go to Tools | Endicia Setup | and make sure "Always Print Stealth Postage" is checked. 


</ol>



<b>Q: Printing International Postage Corrupts the Layout</b><br><BR>

<b>A:</b> Delete the corrupted layout and create a new one.<br>
<p><BR><BR>
<b>Q: The shipping label prints incorrectly, i.e., without postage, barcodes, etc., </b><br>
<p>
Did you recently switch your label format?  For example, did you recently switch from Domestic Priority mail class to print International Global Priority shipping labels?  The problem may be this - The previously selected label format is saved in memory.
<p>
<b>A:</b> Please try the following simple solution:  <p>
<ol>
<li>Open Endicia Dazzle, re-select your preferred/default shipping class, i.e., Domestic Priority Mail, and <B>CLOSE</B> the program.  
<li>Answer, "yes" when prompted to save the (changed) format before closing.  
<li>Now, print the label again.  Right-click the order, choose shipping Labels, and choose Endicia Dazzle Labels.  
<li>The shipping label should print fine this time!</ol> 
.<br>
<br>
<B>Q:  When I try to print Envelope Rate (for those packages weighing less than 3.5 oz), the postage class automatically switches to Package, or some other class not desired.</B><br>
<B>A:</B>  Since the change in rate classes (as detailed below), many facets of shipping with online postage have also changed, based on the dimensions of the package as well as the weight. Previously used layouts have codes embedded in them that tell Dazzle what rate class to use. So, if you are using a custom layout that was based off of any other layout than the DaZzle Standard, "Envelope", it will likely give this error. 
<BR><BR>
Steps to make it work:
<BR><BR>
<OL>
<LI>In DaZzle, open the Envelope standard layout. 
<LI>Change the media type to suit your needs.
<LI>Save the layout with a custom name - something you can recognize.
<LI>This will take care of the issue of the postage class changing, and you can print at envelope rate. 
</OL>
<BR>
<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
The Envelope Rate Class can ONLY be used if your package is less than .25 inches thick, AND weighs less than 3.5 ounces. Also, this weight class does not permit Delivery Confirmation. 
</div>
</aside>


<BR><BR>
<B>General Troubleshooting with Custom Labels:</B><BR><BR>

Custom label layouts settings override Zoovy Order Manager. Since the majority of our customers use a custom label, please review the following if you have trouble printing from Order Manager to Endicia/DaZzle.
<BR><BR>

If a label fails to print and a custom layout is being used, please load 
Endicia and open a new, standard layout from Endicia. Configure the same package geometry (e.g. weight, package dimensions, shipping address) and see if Endicia can print out the label <B>BEFORE</B> contacting Zoovy support.<BR><BR>
When USPS changes their rules and adds new package types, those package 
types may not be supported by custom layouts and may need to be added.
<BR><BR>
This specifically affects settings such as Stealth Postage not printing. 
<BR><BR>

<div>USPS made significant changes to their mail classes recently. Formerly, the following mail classes were supported: First Class Mail, First Class Postcard Rate, Priority Mail, Priority Mail Flat Rate Env., Priority Mail Flat Rate Box, Package Services Parcel Post, Package Services Media Mail, Package Services Library, Package Services Bound Printed Matter, Express Mail, Express Mail Flat Rate Env., Presorted Standard First-Class, Presorted Standard Class, Global Express Guaranteed, Global Express Guaranteed Non-Documents, Global Express Mail, Global Priority Mail, Global Priority Mail Small Flat Rate, Global Priority Mail Large Flat Rate, International Economy Letter, International Air Letter, International Postcard, International Aerogramme, International Economy Parcel, and International Air Parcel.<br>

This list has been significantly shortened.<br>
The new mail classes are: First Class Mail, Priority Mail, Parcel Post, Media Mail, Library Mail, Bound Printed Matter, Express Mail, Presorted First-Class, Presorted Standard Class, International First Class, International Express Mail, International Priority Mail, Global Express Guaranteed, Global Express Guaranteed Non-Documents.

<div>If you update a template in Vista (likely Windows 7 too, we haven't tested it) save the new file with the same name (ie hit Save, not Save As).  If the file has a new name it will not be made available to use in Dazzle.  This is because it is saved in a virtual directory in Vista. This is a known Endicia (not Zoovy) bug.

<h2>Mapping Postage Type to Rating/Carrier</h2>

<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>
Depending if you are on the latest version of OM, you could have a carrier code field so this may not be needed

</div>
</aside>


By default Zoovy Order Manager won't know which shipping methods in your store map to which postage types in Endicia.

To do this you will need to map the shipping/rating type to an Endicia service. 

For example you might have a rating method called "Regular Shipping" which maps to "Priority Mail" on the

Endicia side of things.<br>

<br>

It is possible to map any shipping method Endicia shipping types. 

To do this simply prepend a code to the front of the shipping 

description (the 4 digit code and pipe symbol will NOT be 

displayed the customers). A list of valid Endicia carrier codes along 

with their  US Postal service names are as follows:




<table border=1>

<tr><td>EFCM|First Class Mail</td></tr>
<tr><td>EPRI|Priority Mail</td></tr>
<tr><td>ESPP|Parcel Post</td></tr>
<tr><td>ESMM|Media Mail</td></tr>
<tr><td>ESLB|Library Mail</td></tr>
<tr><td>ESBM|Bound Printed Matter</td></tr>
<tr><td>EXPR|Express Mail</td></tr>
<tr><td>EPFC|Presorted, First-Class</td></tr>
<tr><td>EPFC|Presorted, Standard Class</td></tr>
<tr><td>EIFC|International First Class</td></tr>
<tr><td>EIEM|International Express Mail</td></tr>
<tr><td>EIPM|International Priority Mail</td></tr>
<tr><td>EGEG|Global Express Guaranteed</td></tr>
<tr><td>EGGN|Global Express Guaranteed, Non-Documents</td></tr>
<tr><td>NONE|Do not print postage</td></tr>



</table>



Example: to create a weight based shipping type named "Regular Shipping" and map it to

the Endicia Priority Mail type simply enter the shipping description as:

EPRI|Regular Shipping (In Web UI, not ZID, new flexible shipping method).
