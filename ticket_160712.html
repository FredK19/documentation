<h2>Issue #160712: Need to upload PHP script for building reciprocal link program</h2>

Is there a way you can put this file under this?
"www.domain.com/directory.php"

<br>

If I upload it to the custom file folder, it became:
http://static.zoovy.com/merchant/user/directory.php


The link exchange will not allowed me for the URL. It has to start with "www.domain.com/"

Or, is there another way to link to custom file folder starting with "www.domain.com/"?

Please help.</article>

<h2>Resolution</h2>
I'm sorry - but our servers don't run PHP, and even if they did you can't upload your own programs because they could take down our servers and/or violate security policies we have in place. 

<br>

The infrastructure which zoovy operates is considerably more sophisticated than a normal hosting/shell account. Zoovy operates multiple active-active data centers and your website is distributed across those data centers. Most PHP scripts require a much simpler environment to operate successfully. 

<br>

Zoovy does not offer have a reciprocal link module because using those (while it builds links which was important in 1999-2003) the modern Google algorithms will actually dilute your ranking when you have a lot of non-relevant inbound and outbound links.  Also many of the reciprocal link programs spam sites.

<br>

However if you still want to maintain a reciprocal link page - you can simply create a category page and manually place links on those pages.

<br>

I should also mention you can create a rewrite rule in the domain configuration to redirect /directory.php to any category page you wish.
