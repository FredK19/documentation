<h1>Order Manager: FedEx Shipping</h1>
<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>










The FedEx&reg; Shipping Manager in Order Manager (FSMOM) functionality provides the ability to print airbills based on orders received in your Zoovy store.
<br>
<br>
There are several key advantages that this feature provides to your business:<br>
<li> Zero Integration Effort - this feature requires no technical expertise to setup or get working. 
Simply designate FedEx&reg; as your primary shipping provider on Zoovy.com and this feature is automatically setup. 

<li> Faster Shipping - because you print the airbills from directly within order manager, 
there is no need to export shipping information, or switch applications, it means you can ship more packages in the same 
amount of time.

<li> Automatic Tracking Import - Tracking numbers are automatically stored in Order Manager, and the orders are automatically
moved to completed once they are shipped. 
Because the tracking numbers are automatically imported back into Zoovy it means the customer can then lookup tracking information 
using their order number on your website rather than going to the FedEx site. 

<li> More Professional Emails - Order Manager can automatically send out HTML Emails that include tracking numbers, 
graphics such as your company logo, links to your website, and personalized marketing messages to your customers. 
This leaves a much more professional impact on your customer than the plain-text emails sent by the FedEx ShipAlert&reg; service.

<li> User Accountability - for multi-user versions of order manager, you can know exactly which employee shipped each package.
Use this information to create reports to gauge employee productivity, and to back-track employee errors. 

<li> More Accurate - No more waiting till the end of the day to import your tracking numbers.
The FSMOM feature automatically sets the ship date in the order file to the actual date and time the airbill was printed.

<article>
<h2>Eligibility</h2>




In order to use FSMOM feature you must have a FedEx&reg; account.
This feature is only compatible with customers who have daily pickup accounts.<br>
<br>
In addition you must have a FedEx&reg; supplied Zebra/Eltron EPL2 based label printer such as the Orion, Zebra 500, LP2342 or LP2844 printers, 
and be using the FedEx&reg; supplied labels - or more specifically supplies part #156148 Format #434 - 6 1/4" x 4" label stock. Endicia 4 x 6 labels are supported for both USPS and FedEx. They can be purchased from http://www.endicia.com/Store/Detail/?ID=40

<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>
If you are using FedEx and your labels are not printing correctly, specifically some information is printing onto the next label, you probably are not using the correct type of labels.  FedEx has labels with and without the "doc tab" labels, and you need the version with, which is referenced by the part number above.  Only this type of label will work.

</div>
</aside>


<aside class="hint">

<div>

At this time Zoovy does not provide label printers or labels to customers - 
customers who need assistance in obtaining these items should contact their Zoovy account manager 
who can then help you locate your FedEx Account Manager and ensure you get the proper equipment and supplies.

If your printer does not generate an error, but also does not respond when attempting to process a shipment, it's possible the wrong printer language is enabled.<br>
Login to ZID Order Manager:  Admin >> Setup >> UPS (or FedEx) Account Setup >> Printer Language.   Select the EPL2 radio button.

<h2>Using non-FedEx rating with FedEx Airbill Printing</h2>

By default any FedEx service which is rated by Zoovy will automatically be mapped to the appropriate shipping type in order manager during printing.  However you may choose to use a Rating service other than FedEx (for example if you offer free shipping) -- in
these circumstances you will want to map your shipping description to a FedEx service so you don't need to select the shipping
service for every airbill.. <br>
<br>
It is possible to map any shipping method (with the exception of USPS/UPS or DHL services) to FedEx service types. 
To do this simply prepend a code to the front of the shipping description (the 4 digit code and pipe symbol will NOT be displayed the customers).
A list of valid codes along with their FedEx service names are as follows:
<table border=1>
<tr><td>FXIG|FedEx International Ground</td></tr>
<tr><td>FXIE|FedEx International Economy</td></tr>
<tr><td>FXIP|FedEx International Priority</td></tr>
<tr><td>FXIF|FedEx International First</td></tr>

<tr><td>FXGR|FedEx Ground</td></tr>
<tr><td>FXHD|FedEx Home Delivery</td></tr>
<tr><td>FXHE|FedEx Evening Home</td></tr>
<tr><td>FXES|FedEx Express Saver: 3 Day</td></tr>
<tr><td>FX2D|FedEx 2 Day</td></tr>
<tr><td>FXSO|FedEx Standard Overnight: 3pm next day</td></tr>
<tr><td>FXPO|FedEx Priority Overnight: 10:30am next day</td></tr>
<tr><td>FXFO|FedEx First Overnight: 8:30am next day</td></tr>
</table>

<aside class="html">
<h6></h6>
<code>

Example: to create a weight based shipping type named "Regular Shipping" and 
map it to the FedEx Domestic Ground service simply enter the shipping 
description as: FXGR|Regular Shipping

<h2>Using this Feature</h2>
From the main order manager view, 
select one or more orders and either Right click, or from the Menu Bar select File | Shipping Labels.
Select the "FedEx&reg;" menu choice.
All the information will be automatically populated from your order.
The residential/commercial address will automatically be populated based on the presence of a company name.
The required fields are in blue, when you are ready to ship the package select "Process Shipment"
If you have selected multiple orders the next order will automatically come up.

</article>

<article>
<h2>FedEx Rate Button</h2>

 As a courtesy to our customers, FedEx provides an estimated rate for a shipment if requested. The courtesy rates returned are estimates and may differ from the actual amount invoiced depending upon the specific circumstances regarding the shipment. <br><br>
 This is only an estimate. The actual amount may differ.<br><br>
 When rate button is pressed we send a request for Gross amount, surchage amount, discount amount, net amount. Again, only the net amount is returned, as per FedEx, they do not return the amount with the discount in place all the time.

</article>

<article>
<h2>Keyed Lookup Mode</h2>
The Keyed Lookup Mode is intended for use by customers who print out their invoices or 
packing slips in order manager, then pick out the items, and who want to avoid the extra step of finding the 
invoice to print out the shipping label.

The Keyed Lookup Mode allows you to simply enter a fully qualified order # (e.g. 2004-10-1234), which can be done
either via the keyboard or more commonly by using a barcode scanner connected to the shipping pc. 

By default the invoices and packing slips printed by Zoovy automatically contain a industry standard "3 of 9" barcode 
at the bottom which can be scanned by virtually any PS2 or USB Barcode scanner.<br>
<br>
Keyed Lookup Mode simply saves the extra step of re-finding the order # in order manager if you already have the invoice
or packing slip in front of you (e.g. you have different people picking and shipping). If you ship dozens of packages a day
this probably isn't a big deal, if you ship thousands of packages a day this is a huge time saver.<br>
<br>
<br>
To enable keyed lookup mode simply go to Tools on the menu bar and select "Keyed Lookup".

*NOTE: For customers who do sufficient shipping volume with FedEx 
it is common practice for FedEx to provide barcode scanners 
along with free personal computers and label printers along with labels for shipping (even ground).

Checking this box will upload the information required in this form directly to FedEx, negating the requirement to fill this form and print it locally.  FedEx instead will have it on file for reference.

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>Your FedEx carrier maybe expecting a "customs form" or "commercial invoice".  You can inform him that as you are using software that sends this information up to FedEx directly, and it is on file for the package already.<br>
<br>

We have the Certified Solution Provider certification from FedEx. This takes extensive testing to get this and maintain it. They not require a Commercial Invoice for international shipping with this certification. If they did, it would be required in our interface.  <br>
<br>

It is not at all uncommon to talk to a FedEx driver, support rep, manager, or even higher up who is not familiar with Certified Solution Provider or perhaps has never even heard of it.<br>
<br>

Commercial Invoices (customs forms) are required for international shipping.  Most countries require 3, some 5. We automatically send an electronic version to FedEx who then prints the appropriate number. FedEx Shipping Manager (their shipping software, of which there are 37 versions such as Server or Frozen Ice, each with their own specialized support reps) does require a paper version.  This is why you often will hear from FedEx employees that it always must be there to ship.  <br>
<br>

If you do speak to a FedEx employee who will not let you ship without the physical paperwork there are two options: <br>
1. Try to escalate through FedEx to get it approved. <br>
2. Configure a printer for Commercial Invoices (Tools >> Commercial Printer Setup). The default number of copies (3) can be changed here as well. Check the Print CI box in the International Tab of the FedEx Interface. ("Print CI" is a little vague on purpose.  If it was "Print Customs Paperwork" many merchants would be needlessly printing this info for every international order.)

Should you need to void a label / tracking number, you can do this via the Zoovy Order Manager interface:  Tools >> Void FedEx Package >> (enter the correct tracking number) and click the Void Tracking button. 

Note:  This can only be done within 24 hrs of printing the label.  If it has been longer than 24 hrs since the label was printed, you will need to contact FedEx to void the transaction.

<h2>Compatible Thermal Label Printers</h2>

Zoovy only certified the "Fedex" EPL2 label printers (which are either Eltron 2348's or Zebra 2844ps's) - no other label printers are certified.
Zoovy opted NOT to build laser printer support for FedEx into our product, and at this time there are no plans to add this as a feature.<br>
<br>
Most Zoovy customers already use, or *SHOULD* use thermal printers - we really encourage them.
If you don't already have one, there are a number of reasons why a company should choose thermal over laser/inkjet:
<li> The cost per print is so much less (explained below)
<li> The professionalism is so much higher
<li> The printers (when purchased from FedEx) are only about $350 w/shipping and tax.
<br>
Why Thermal are Cheaper: A laser and/or inkjet adds anywhere from 10-30 seconds per label - 
if you assume an employee is $10/hr. so it's like $0.083 per label savings on a thermal printer so after 4,000 packages 
(~ 10 rolls of labels) the printer has paid for itself. <br>
<br>
Now if you factor in the cost of the inkjet cartridge ($40) or the toner in a laser printer ($100), 
or the additional time involved to separate a large adhesive laser/inkjet labels, and/or the time+cost to tape the plain-paper label to the package - 
it doesn't take a math genius to figure out that Thermal printers typically pay for themselves in 3-6 months even for very low volume merchants.<br>
<br>
Even on the trivial costs the power consumption per print on a thermal printer is less (*way* less than a laser).
The laser printers (when printing on adhesive labels) also generate substantially more garbage (2x-3x) -- worse for the environment, and also
depending on your county the paper goods must be recycled separately.
<br>
Also residential inkjet and/or laser printers tend to break down after a year or less in a warehouse/continuous use situation, 
especially in situations with extreme temperatures. 
As near as we can tell laser labels are really only right for multi-use scenarios, and/or infrequent shippers 
(and honestly, if you're an infrequent shipper why are you using Zoovy?). 
Not only are the print mechanisms much more reliable but the entire paper path, and feed mechanism on a thermal printer 
is much more reliable since it has dramatically less moving parts -- this means less re-prints, less hassle, more productivity.<br>
<br>
You can purchase the Printers directly from:
