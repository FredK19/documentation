<h1>Understanding SSL Certificates differences for the non-mathlete</h1>

<article>
<h2>Concept Overview</h2>
SSL Certificates

<br>
We apologize in advance for the technical nature of this document. It is 
impossible to coherently try and explain the differences between SSL 
Certificate types without at least a light discussion of crypographic 
protocols.
<br>

Zoovy provides 4 different SSL Certificate "Flavors". They are:<br>
<br>
<li>Rapid SSL - 256 bit
<li>Trustwave Premium - 256 bit
<li>GeoTrust SSL Premium - 256 bit
<li>Trustwave EV (Extended Validation) - 256 bit<br>
<br>

The number of "bits" refers to the maximum number of "password" 
combinations which need to be tried to "guess" the correct key. With a 
256 bit certificate it means there are 2 to the 256^th power, or 
roughly: 
115,792,089,237,316,195,423,570,985,008,690,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
possible guesses necessary (give or take a few sextillion) to try and 
guess all possible passwords.<br>
<br>
That number is the amount of guesses which could be necessary to guess 
the key to decrypt a single session. Unlike Hollywood movies, strong encryption can't be broken in seconds, there are no backdoors, or secret pass phrases or anything like that.  However it is currently possible to use some 
very elegant cracking techniques to eliminate huge ranges of numbers, so 
an accomplished mathlete can reasonably reduce a 256 bit cipher down to around 
2^107^th power or roughly: 162,259,276,829,213,363,391,578,010,288,130 
possible guesses necessary using publicly available attacks. 
Needless to say even attempting a few quadrillion combinations per second, they wouldn't finish before sun goes supernova. So "guessing" the password after a few tries is probably out, sorry Hollywood.

<div> If you ever see those $250,000 guaranteed protection from an 
SSL vendor, what they're saying is - if somebody "guesses" the key, 
they'll pay up to $250,000 in insurance. It's hilarious - you've got a 
better chance of winning a jackpot vegas, at the same time being struck by lightning, 
while being eaten by a shark!

But a way for a bad guy to get a persons credit card doesn't necessarily
require guessing, a better way would be to find a way to take over your 
DNS, and -pretend- to be you. That way they'd serve up a secure page and 
the buyer would (being unaware it wasn't your store) gladly hand over 
their credit card details to the nefarious international hackers.

Secure & Trusted DNS is a key component to ensuring SSL functionality. This is 
one reason Zoovy asks clients to transfer their DNS to us rather than 
use outside nameservers. We do not allow modification (hijacking) of 
names under our control without going through some extremely rigorous 
security protocols including voice verification. You'd be amazed how few 
checks a $6/yr. domain registrar will go through before turning over 
your domain to a bad guy pretending to be you. (It's literally just a 
matter of sending a fax with a plausible story on made-up letterhead)

For this reason SSL includes a "identity verification" component - 
basically there are a series of companies on the Internet such as 
Geotrust, Trustwave, Verisign, RapidSSL, Thawte, and a few dozen others 
who browsers "trust" to verify your company's identity. The browsers come 
preloaded with the "Root Certificates" for these companies. When your 
browser connects to your server (hosted by Zoovy) it downloads the 
certificate, then attempts to verify that certificate against the 
certificates it has installed. I'm not going to go into how this 
happens, it's beyond the scope of this document - but suffice to say 
it's a mathematically proven algorithm used to determine that your 
certificate was created by a trusted certificate.<br>
<br>
Of course lets think like the bad guys for a moment: if they could get 
an SSL certificate, that's issued to you, loaded on their webservers - well 
then they could still -pretend- to be you, and again the unsuspecting 
buyer wouldn't have a clue they weren't actually talking to you. So how 
does a bad guy get an SSL certificate pretending to be you? Well you'd 
be amazed how easy it is.<br>
<br>
Each company who has a "root certificate" which is trusted by the 
browsers, goes through different internal protocols to verify your 
identity, so that they don't accidentally issue a certificate that 
claims to be you to somebody who isn't you. In practice they all do a 
sufficient job to stop a lazy criminal, and some companies definitely do 
a better job than others. If a company accidentally issues a certificate 
to the bad guys, then they're going to find their root certificates 
removed in a future version of each browser and subsequently be out of 
business. However the level of checking they do is what you pay for. Of 
course -- to the browser (and to 99.9999999% of all end-users) all SSL 
certificates that are issued from any trusted root certificate are 
treated the same, they get the same lock, etc. - the math they use to 
protect the session is the same, there is no difference on the grade of 
encryption. The only difference is if you click the lock in the browser 
it will tell you who the issuing party is. Theoretically some 
applications (military, defense, b2b) might remove "less trusted" 
certificates .. however in practice this never really happens.<br>
<br>
So why the difference in price, what do you pay for? Well - mostly 
branding. RapidSSL is inexpensive, but it's brand name is regarded as a 
"budget" brand in most cryptographic circles.  They will issue a 
certificate to pretty much anybody who can get an email at a domain - 
it's easy and painless (which isn't a good thing in security circles - a 
little pain equals "rigorous checking").<br>
<br>
Geotrust and Trustwave both do a good job checking, and give you cool 
little badges you can drop on your site telling people "it's secure" .. 
here at Zoovy we like them because both badges have the word "trust" in 
them. Buyers can click the little badges and their sites will use all 
sorts of big crytographic words to tell them how secure your site is. 
Most studies indicate that buyers don't want to deal with real security, 
they just want to feel secure - and the more you can do to make them 
feel warm and fuzzy about your security the more likely they are to buy 
from you. Keep in mind that both RapidSSL, GeoTrust SSL, and TrustWave 
SSL offer the same cryptographic levels - none are more secure than the 
other, all are trusted by the same browsers, it's just branding.<br>
<br>
Lastly is an EV SSL Certificate - and this is a bit different. EV stands 
for "Extended Validation", and is the security communities attempt to 
remedy the failure of SSL to provide a differentiation between different 
levels of "identity verification", it's also being used as a way to 
dramatically increase the cost (and subsequent profit) on issuing SSL 
certificates by everybody in the industry.<br>
<br>
<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
The easiest way to see an EV certificate in action is to go to 
www.paypal.com <http://www.paypal.com/> you'll notice the URL turns 
"green" (which is supposed to indicate "it's safe"), and it also clearly 
shows the company name - rather than the domain name as "Paypal, Inc." 
this is important because it tells you that the person who issued the EV 
certificate for Paypal.com did so for a company named "Paypal, Inc." 
which is who you're supposed to be doing business with. 

</div>
</aside>

Again in reality, 99.999999% of the people in world never notice this. Verisign 
(who sells EV certificates for ridiculous fees and stands to make a lot 
by Fortune 500 CIO's deciding they should "go green") is doing a big 
marketing campaign called "if it's not green, it's not secure". EV 
Issues are supposed to do a more thorough background check before 
issuing a certificate - and in exchange the browsers trust them.


<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>

Keep in mind you're supposed to buy 1 SSL certificate per server it's 
loaded on, so big banks, etc. this might be millions of dollars in just 
SSL certificates. We don't recommend Verisign because their certificates 
are priced substantially higher than other brands.


</div>
</aside>



So what does this mean to you - absolutely nothing. There is no 
difference in the security afforded, simply the branding.<br>
<br>

Besides in practice most bad guys never actually attack the 
cryptography, or even try and circumvent the SSL certificate simply 
because it is way easier to harvest the bank account pins, using worms 
and keystroke loggers (and none of this SSL voodoo really protects 
buyers from that).
<br>

If Verisign keeps dumping money into it's "if it's not green, it's not 
secure" pro-EV advertising campaigns then EV certificates could become 
important to consumers. In practice 99% of people in the world (who 
don't work in IT) have no idea who Verisign is, so better off going with 
a Trustwave EV certificate.<br>
