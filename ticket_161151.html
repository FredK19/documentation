<h2>Resolution</h2>
Hello,

You've changed the options on this product (NGSLECTRASXW30) on Zoovy and now it doesn't match the same product on Amazon, which is why the order is saying "Pog mismatch". 

To correct this problem, delete the product from Amazon syndication, wait 24 hrs for it to delete and then re-check it to syndicate with your current options. Keep in mind that only products with "Store Option Groups" ie SOGs are syndicatable to Amazon.

Please reopen this ticket if you have any further questions.
Thanks,
Patti
