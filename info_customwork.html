<h1>Custom Work Overview</h1>

<article>
<h2>Custom Work for your Zoovy Store</h2>

Nearly every piece of your Zoovy Store can be customized to tailor your specific needs.  This document is designed to give a basic overview of the most commonly customized pieces.  If you have questions or comments about the various pieces listed here, or about pieces not listed here, please contact your Account Manager.

<h2>The Parts of your Zoovy Store</h2>
The structure of a Zoovy Store breaks down into two main components: Website Theme and Page Layout.
<br>

<section>
<h3>Website Theme</h3>
<li>Contains the bulk of the store branding and site navigation.
<li>Contains the pieces that are, for the most part, consistent throughout your store (logo, navigation, search, etc).
</section>

<section>
<h3>Page Layout</h3>
<li>Template that loads the individual page content within a Theme. 
<li>Contains page specific information, such as product, text, images, etc.

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
There are several types of Page Layouts, each one designed specifically to display a certain type of information (ie, Products, Categories, Homepage, etc).

</div>
</aside>


</section>

<h2>Website Theme or 'Theme' (aka wrapper)</h2>
A Theme can contain (but is not limited to):
<li>Company Logo</li>
<li>Utility Links (ie, home, about, contact info, store policies, cart, checkout)</li>
<li>Keyword Search form</li>
<li>Navigation links which can contain any of the utility links as well as 
store specific links (ie, specials, featured items)</li>
<li>Page title (the page title is the only element in the wrapper that will change, 
displaying the title of the page you are on.</li>
<li>Main Category Navigation (lists all the top level product categories in your store)</li>
<li>Other Forms (ie, newsletter signup, login)</li>
<li>Bottom Navigation which usually mirrors all of the links at the top of the site</li>



<section>
<h3>Popup Theme</h3>
The Popup Theme is basically a mini version of the Website Theme, and is used for small Popup windows that display various types of information in your Zoovy Store.  Most often, it is used when data needs to be collected from the user, such as tell a friend, product reviews, etc.
</section>

<h2>Page Layouts</h2>

Layouts contain the page specific content.  This content may include:
<li>Promotional Banners or Advertisements
<li>Product Lists, which are a way of displaying different sets of products that have something to do with each other (ie, new items, featured items). Products shown can display many different pieces of information about that product (ie, thumbnail, name, price) 
<li>Text blurbs. Though large paragraphs of text are rarely read, it is sometimes 
helpful to have a sentence or two of intro text. 

<br>

Features Available for a Custom Designed Layout:
<li>Promotional Banners with Changeable links</li>
<li>Newsletter Signup form</li>
<li>Log in form</li>
<li>Product Lists</li>
<li>Navigation</li>


<section>
<h3>Homepage</h3>
The Homepage is the first page that loads when someone first comes to your site. The information there often gives shoppers the first impression of your store, and it should direct people to where they should click to next.
</section>


<section>
<h3>Category Layout</h3>
The category pages typically contain a product list, and perhaps a text area at the top or bottom.  The product list on this page can use our 'multipage' feature, so that the product can be broken down into smaller chunks, to maximize efficiency.
</section>

<section>
<h3>Product Layout</h3>

The Product layout is the page that showcases a specific Product and displays all of the information associated with that Product. It is also the most common page from which a customer will add a Product to their shopping cart.
<br>
Product Pages contain some elements which are not present on home or category pages
<li>Pricing (ie, base price, msrp, quantity discounts)</li>
<li>Product Options if present (ie, color, size)</li>
<li>Add to Cart button </li>
<li>Product Lists for Related items and/or Accessories</li>
<li>Tell a Friend</li>
<li>Product Reviews</li>
<li>Related Categories (a list of all the categories this product resides in)</li>

</section>


<section>
<h3>Search Results</h3>

Like a category layout, the search results layout is designed to list product.  Search results can also support multipage for when large amounts of results are present.

</section>

<section>
<h3>Other</h3>

Most of the pages in your Zoovy store can be customized.  For instance, your about us, contact, or returns pages can all employ custom layouts to achieve a specific look and feel.  Custom contact pages can contain more complex forms for acquiring information from your customers.  Though checkout can be customized through the system to enable/disable features and change messaging, the basic structure of checkout can not be modified (even with a custom layout).

<li>Company Branding
