[[SECTION]Concept Overview]
[[TAG]word=1000]

Wishpot is an online service that lets your customers add any item from your store to their Wishpot wish list or registry. Itâ€™s perfect for your customers to use as a gift list, birthday wish list, wedding registry, honeymoon registry, baby registry, Christmas list, etc.  <br>
<br>
Once an item on your customer's list is reserved by one of their friends, Wishpot redirects whoever is purchasing the item to your site to purchase the product.To learn more about Wishpot, please visit the following URL:
[[BREAK]]
http://www.wishpot.com

Wishpot gives merchants an additional storefront in a social media / networking environment at a minimal cost.
[[BREAK]]
Zoovy clients receive no monthly fees from Wishpot. A 3% CPA (Cost Per Action) is applied for any referred sales. Wishpot is integrated into the built-in Zoovy product layouts. Sites with custom product layouts will need to pay the hourly design rates for updates to their custom layouts so the "Add to Wishlist" icon is available on product pages. Orders generated by this service will appear on your Zoovy invoice with the affiliate code "WISHPOT".<br>

[[HINT]]
Wishpot is considered marketing service and any assistance setting up the account or configuring the Facebook plugin would be billable at the hourly rate of $100.
[[/HINT]]


[[SECTION]How Does It Work?]

[[HINT]]
You will need to enable products to get added to the feed by setting the following attribute on products wishpot:ts to 1 (enable) -1 (disable).  This can easily be done either by CSV or via the Product Power Tool.
[[/HINT]]

Zoovy will feed over all products within categories to an 'All Products' list in Wishpot.  If there are product "lists" created in Zoovy these will feed directly into Wishpot into their own separate list.  For this reason list management for Wishpot should be managed on the Zoovy side.  Product Lists should be created specifically for Wishpot and they should be named something relevant or the "pretty name" as the title of the list cannot be changed once it feeds over to Wishpot.  
<br>
As a default all categories and lists are fed over to Wishpot.  If you wish to alter this behavior log into Zoovy>syndication>Wishpot>Edit>Categories.  Here you should select Send or Do Not Send.  Changes will reflect after 24 hours.<br>

[[CAUTION]]
By clicking on "Do Not Send" will block all products within that particular category from sending up to Wishpot.  If there are products mapped to multiple categories the item may not go up at all if it's being blocked by another category.  You can disable a product from being included in the feed by setting the wishpot:ts to -1
[[/CAUTION]]
[[/SECTION]]<br>

[[SECTION]How Do I Sign Up?]
<li> Submit a support ticket with subject of "Wishpot"
<li> Include an email address that you'd like the account be set up on.  This email address is visible to shoppers.<br>

[[CAUTION]]
Personal Wishpot accounts are different then Vendor accounts, please open a support ticket to have the correct account created for you.
