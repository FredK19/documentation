<h2>Error: Database could not be found</h2>
If you go to sign into Order Manager 8.x and get a pop-up that says database cannot be found, here are the follow things you should ask yourself before proceeding.
<li> Has a new user been added?
<li> Was a password changed recently?
<li> Did I install the correct software?
<li> When was the last time I logged in successfully on this machine to ZID?
<li> Am I typing my username with the correct case? (case sensitive)
<br>
After answering these questions there are two routes that you can take next.
<ol>Route 1: Open a support ticket to have a tech log in to your machine and troubleshoot the error. When opening this ticket be sure to include the answer to the question above.

Route 2:Troubleshoot the issue yourself by checking the software versions and/or if a password was created/changed, you will need to do a nuke config. Use caution when doing this. You will need admin password and database password.

<aside class="hint">

<div>If you are unsure about the nuke config you should probably take route 1.
