<h2>Issue</h2>
Issue:  Supply Chain sends zoovy product id, instead of supplier sku.

<br>

Automated supply chain order emails show the Product ID in the SKU column instead of the actual MFG SKU - Supplier gets confused and isn't sure which product to ship out.
This is affecting my business - orders get delayed.

Try setting the field zoovy:prod_supplierid instead of zoovy:prod_mfgid
