<h2>Goals</h2>
The goal of this project is to familiarize yourself with the in's and outs of the Zoovy user interface, creating sub-users, changing your password, and how to interact with Zoovy support, and review/update project status and make future decisions about the next implementation steps. This orientation should help you learn how to navigate the site and find where to go for information on various topics.

<h2>Planning</h2>

Product Identifiers or Product ID's for short, are unique alphanumeric codes that identify your products. Product ID's can be a combination of numbers and letters, and are case insensitive. For example, ABC1 is the same as abc1.<br><br>
A SKU or Stock Keeping Unit, is the fully qualified identifier for a product that includes the options selected. SKUs are the product id plus any options that might be available. The Options are separated by dashes.

<h2>Products in Web Manager</h2>

Product Management via the website is accomplished by logging into your account and clicking on the Products Tab. 
<br>
<b>What is a Product ID?</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Product Identifiers (Product ID's for short) are unique alphanumeric codes
that identify your products. Product ID's can be a combination of numbers and letters, and are case
insensitive. For example, ABC1 is the same as abc1.<br>
<br>
<b>What is a SKU?</b><br>
Zoovy uses Product ID's to track indivdual products.
Products can have options such as size, color, weight, etc. these options are called "Product Option Groups".  
When an order is created the Product ID is combined with the chosen product options to create the SKU.
For example:
HAT might be the product id, while HAT-R might be the SKU (for a red hat).
<br>
<b>How do I add Pictures?</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you have created the product, you can add images in the product management area.
Click on the link labelled "Product Pictures" to access your image library.<br>
<br>
<b>What is the Base Price?</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The base price is the price in US dollars for the product. It is called the base
price because if you add options later, those options may modify the price.<br>
<br>
<b>What is the Base Weight?</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The base weight is measured in ounces, and is the shipping weight of the product with packaging.
If you use Product Options (eg: size), the Base Weight may be modified by those product options, so a large can
add weight, or a small could subtract weight. If your product does not use Product Options, the base weight
will automatically be used as the shipping weight.
<br>
<br>
<font size="-1">
<b>TIP</b>: If none of your shipping methods require weight (such as local delivery, customer pickup, flag rate, and
simple shipping) then you can ignore the weight field; a value of ZERO ounces will be assumed.<br>
<br>
<b>TRICK</b>: If you know how many pounds (lbs) a product is, then enter the number of pounds and then press
the # key, then press tab and weight will be converted to ounces. Example: if you have a product that is three
pounds, simply type 3 then press #, then press TAB and you'll see the field change to 48 ounces.<br>
</font>
<br>
<b>How do I know if my Product is taxable?</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a rule, services are not taxable, but products are taxable. So if you can hold it,
then it's probably taxable. There are plenty of exceptions to this rule (eg: food); you should always
contact your local board of equalization, or your local business licensing bureau. <br>
To configure your tax preferences, you need to enter the "Sales Tax Calculation" section in the
"Setup" area of the Zoovy website. Click on the "Setup" tab
located in the upper menu bar of the Zoovy Merchant site.<br>
<br>
<b>How do I save?</b><br>
Just click the "Create Now" button in the lower portion of the screen. By clicking the "Create Now" button
your browser will take you to the product management screen where you can proceed to customize your
product. From there you will able
to further customize your product by adding images, and adding your product to your website.<br>

<h2>Planning</h2>

Like any brick and mortar store you must do some planning before jumping in.  Naming your products in consideration of any shipping or promotional rules can save you valuable time in the future.
</article>
<article>
<h2>Shipping</h2>

Zoovy allows you to configure your shipping the way you really ship rather than forcing you into a universal shipping method.  You may want to use UPS for all ground shipments and USPS for next day air.  Or you may want to ship certain products via FedEx and others only by USPS.  To do this you will need to set up shipping rules.  Shipping rules require filters.  So if you name all your products that will only ship via FedEx similar to FSKU1234, then your filter could be easily setup to only offer FedEx shipping on F*.
</article>
<article>
<h2>Promotions</h2>

Zoovy also allows you to setup special promotions and coupons.  The promotions and coupons also require rules and filters, so planning ahead when naming your products is really important.

<h2>Changing your admin password</h2>

For security purposes you should change your password every 60 days. You can easily do this by logging into your account and going to setup, then account settings then change password. This will ensure the safety and privacy of your account. 
</article>

<article>
<h2>Creating Sub-Users</h2>
Creating sub-users for your account will increase security. We suggest that you don't use your administrative login if possible and instead set up a sub-user login. This also helps manage and keep track of different employee accounts.
<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
If you plan to use Zoovy to host your email, you can create users with mail accounts at the domain subuser@username.zoovy.com, then you can establish mail aliases and then later on when you migrate your domains to Zoovy you will already have those accounts setup.

<h2>Accessing Support</h2>
Zoovy provides a number of ways to access support for your Zoovy account. In the support section you can view the various methods. The WebDoc is a great free resource for finding information on the Zoovy software. You can search for Frequently Asked Questions under "Ask Ozmo" or you can ask specific questions and report problems on the community forums. 
If you have a more in depth issue you can submit an electronic ticket requesting help from a technician. For more pressing issues you can call Support for immediate phone assistance by dialing (866) 899-6689. To schedule a phone appointment to discuss a specific project, you can pick a time slot under the support section. 
<section>
<h3>Implementation Assistance vs. Tech Support</h3>
</section>
Knowing who to turn to with specific questions will save you time and effort. Implementation Assistance will help you with configuring your account. These consultants can help you with specific projects. Tech Support is available to help you with other questions about your account that may come up. To prevent completing steps out of order, these requests shouldn't be part of an already open project. 
<section>
<h3>How Implementation Appointments Work</h3>
</section>
You can setup an Implementation Appointment for assistance with a specific project or goal. In your Zoovy account simply select support and then click on "Schedule Appointment" with Live Support. Before scheduling an appointment you should have a specific goal and project code that you would like to cover. This will make your appointment much more productive and efficient. 
<section>
<h3>Electronic Tickets</h3>
</section>
If you are having an issue with your account you can submit an electronic ticket requesting support. Go to the support link in your Zoovy account and click on "Ask Question" under Electronic Support. This will direct you to a submission page where you can describe the issue. Be as descriptive as possible so that your ticket will be directed to the appropriate technician, and they will be prepared to assist you. Each ticket should only cover one issue, and each issue should be covered in one ticket to improve efficiency. 
<section>
<h3>Callback Tickets</h3>
</section>
In the interest of saving you time, you can request that a Zoovy technician call you so that you don't have to wait on hold. Under the support page you can request a callback between Monday-Friday 10am-5pm PST.
