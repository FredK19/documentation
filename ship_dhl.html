<h2>Release Notes</h2>

This feature was initially released on Jan 4th, 2005. 
We added this to help us evaluate demand for DHL products among our userbase - your feedback/comments are requested.<br>

<br>
At this time only rating of domestic packages is supported. DHL has informed us that they will have an
international rating programming interface available for us in Q2 of 2005. When it is released we will
gauge popularity of this feature before deciding to implement it (so if this something you want please
post in the features forum).<br>
<br> 

At this time no airbill generation support is provided in Order Manager and no support is currently planned. 
We have not had enough demand for this feature, again if this something you would like to see please post 
a note in the features forum.<br>
<br>

Finally the DHL Parcel Select service is not currently supported (this is where DHL uses the post office
to carry your package the last mile) - if you ship using this service please let us know so we can 
evaluate adding support for it. The programming interface for this is not currently documented by DHL
but we have been told that we could get access if we had customers who were using this service.<br>
