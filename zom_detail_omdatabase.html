<h2>Reset Database</h2>

The Reset Database tool is a maintenance tool that allows you to destroy all local information and completely clear your database. By doing this it will cause the Order Manager client to automatically download all of your information from the Zoovy servers. Using this tool will cause you to lose any changes you have made since the last syncrhonization. You should not use this tool unless instructed to by Zoovy technical support.
