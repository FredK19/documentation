<h2>Channel Refresh Frequency</h2>


Channels should only refresh when they are updated by a marketplace. You should read the Channel details to see how often a channel will be updated by a marketplace - For example some are updated every four hours, others may never be updated.

<h2>Revoking Channels</h2>

You can revoke or remove a channel by going onto the zoovy website and selecting the Manage tab then going to Channel Manager. 
Find the channel number (or search by auction number), and then click "Edit" under the channel ID. 
From there you can modify the properties and check the status.<br><br>

Keep in mind that revoking a channel will cause Zoovy stop any relisting of that channel. Removing a channel will do the same but also
attempt to end the item on Ebay and award the item to the highest bidder.  Deleting a channel can only be accomplished after issuing a Revoke
or Remove.  Deleting a channel will also end the item on Ebay and award the item to the highest bidder. 

If you haven't done so already you may want to take a look at the Zoovy Product Manager for your 
Windows PC which offers a much better interface to working with Channels.
