<h2>Special Considerations</h2>

For Books: You should always set zoovy:prod_isbn<br>
For DVD and Video you should always set zoovy:prod_upc<br>
<br>

The DVD and Video category requires that the zoovy:prod_format be set to one of the following:
VHS, Beta, 8mm, Laser Disc, DVD, VCD <br>
<br>

The Music cateogry requires that the zoovy:prod_format be set to one of the following:
CD, Cassette, MiniDisc, LP, EP, 45 <br>
<br>

Unless otherwise specified all products are transmitted as "NEW" - to specify otherwise you must either set 
zoovy:prod_condition to "New" or "Used", or yshop:prod_condition to any of the following: 
new, like new, very good, good, acceptable.<br>
<br>

<aside class="caution">

If some of your images are blank in your Yahoo listing, it is most commonly an issue at Yahoo.
Yahoo caches the images on their servers and when they have a problem downloading an image they
put a blank one in it's place.  If this happens contact Yahoo technical support and ask them 
to flush the image cache.

For instance, you may charge a flat shipping rate of $2.50 for all CDs, but $3.50 for all DVDs, in the shipping-class field for all CDs, etc. You will need to create as many shipping classes as necessary to account for all the variations in your shipping charges.
