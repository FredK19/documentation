<h2>Before your upgrade to Network appointment</h2>
Once you have setup your appointment for upgrading to Network order manager go to the download section in your Zoovy acount (this is located at the top right of your screen) and you will find links, then you will need to do the following: <br>


<br>
On the master machine:
Download and install the following:
<li>.Net 3.5 Framework sp1 (will require rebooting the computer).
<li>MySQL Connector/Net 5.2.5 - Windows Binaries (zipped MSI installer)(should be around 3.3-3.9MB file)
<li>Windows Installer 4.5 (may require rebooting the computer).
