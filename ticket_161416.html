<h1>"Continue Shopping" Cart Behavior</h1>

<article>
<h2>Issue</h2>
Issue: "shop more" or "continue shopping" button in shopping cart.  What is the behavior of this link?

<br>

If you visit any of my specialty websites, and when you add items into the shopping cart, and then click on the "shop more" button, it takes you to a specific category page. How do we specify what category page the customer gets taken to after he clicks on the "shop more" button?

<h2>Resolution</h2>
The "shop more" or on some sites also called the "continue shopping" button/link,  destination isn't configurable.  The behavior of that button/link is to take the customer back to the last category page that they visited.
<br>
So if the customer was in your "brown shoes" category, viewed a product in this category, added the product to the cart, then clicked on the "shop more" button, it would bring them back to the "brown shoes" category page.
<br>
If a customer has not yet visited a category the behavior will bring the customer back to the homepage. Example, if a customer is on your site, and they add a product from the homepage, the "shop more" button will bring them back to the homepage, as they had not yet been to a category page to return them to.
