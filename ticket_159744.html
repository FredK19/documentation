<h2>Issue #159744: Correcting the Mysql "max_allowed_packet" error messages on Enterprise</h2>

When running Enterprise sync manager I am trying to sync images and am receiving the error "packets larger than max packet are not allowed.  I also cannot see any image in warehouse manager

</article>

<article>
<h2>Resolution</h2>

Here are the steps to correct the "Packet too large", "max allowed packet exceeded", or "packets larger than max_allowed_packet are not allowed" error messages. 

<br>

<aside class="cbc">
<h6>Increasing the max_allowed_packet size on Mysql</h6>
<div>
<li> Make sure all Enterprise clients are disconnected and sync manager is turned off.
<li> On the database server type Start | Run | type "cmd" then at the dos prompt type "net stop mysql"
<li> Open a copy of notepad and navigate to C:\program files\mysql\mysql server 5.0\ and open the file "my.ini"
<li> search for a line that appears like:<br>
max_allowed_packet=1M

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
the 1M means 1 megabyte, your number may be different depending on your configuration

</div>
</aside>


The max_allowed_packet= will likely be below the entry:
<aside class="html">
<h6></h6>
<code>
[mysqld]

</code>
</aside>


<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
If the max_allowed_packet=1M line does not appear, then you will need to add it on it's own line, immediately below the [mysqld] line. If you don't have a [mysqld] line then you're looking at the wrong file.

</div>
</aside>


To complete the step change the max_allowed_packet=1M from 1M (1 megabyte) to something larger such as 16M (16 megabytes). This number will need to be larger than your largest possible image.

<li> When you are done - save the my.ini
<li> from the dos command window opened in step 2 - type "net start mysql"
<li> restart sync manager
