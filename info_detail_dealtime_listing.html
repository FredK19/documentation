<li> Tell us about your feed file.  Select 'I have a feed file only'<br>
<li> Write down the following information for your records.<br>
<li> 'Print for your records' is highly recommended since getting back to this section will require a reset of the previous steps.<br>
<li> In a separate window/tab login to Zoovy.com, go to: Setup >> Syndication >> Shopping.com and select the desired Profile's EDIT link.<br>
<li> Enter the FTP location (ftp.shopping.com), username and password into the spaces provided.<br>

<li> Click Continue. The next area will let you map your feed's columns. This is normally automatically done for you.

[[HINT]]The FTP location that you will recieve from Shopping.com will look something like "ftp://ftp.shopping.com/", for the "Shopping.com FTP Server:" field in zoovy, simply use the "ftp.shopping.com" portion of the address rather than the whole URL.[[/HINT]]<br>
