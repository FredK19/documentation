<h2>Issue #160040: Can't find products using search</h2>

I went to Zoovy to try and search for the following items:

<br>

Zoovy Product #: "ST3400633A_USED"
Search Terms Used:  "Seagate 400 GB", "Seagate IDE 400 GB","B000H3CI1E"

<br>

Zoovy Product #: "ST94011A_REF"
Search Terms Used:  "Seagate 40 GB", "Seagate IDE 40 GB","B000FL8U1U"

<br>

Using the search terms listed above, I could not find these products through Zoovy search.

<h2>Resolution</h2>
The normal search is a substring search, not a keyword search - which means that you must type the text as it appears. If the Title is "USED 40 GB SEAGATE ST3400633A" then 

"40 GB Seagate"  - works
but  "Seagate 40" does not... but you can also search for parts of a model number e.g.

if the model # is ST3400633A and that is in the title then you can search for 633A and it will come up.
