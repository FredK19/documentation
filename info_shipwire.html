[[SECTION]What is ShipWire?]
[[TAG]shipwire=1000]
[[TAG]fulfillment=1000]

Running a retail business doesn't have to involve so much grinding work on storage and shipping. With a few clicks a growing business can arrange to have inventory sent to Shipwire warehouses, integrate Shipwire with their Zoovy Web site and start fulfilling customer orders in real-time.

[[BREAK]]

Shipwire handles the storage, the packing, the shipping and other logistical details from warehouses in Chicago, Los Angeles, and Toronto, with more scheduled to come online around the world.

[[BREAK]]

Once the domain of large enterprises, Shipwire enables garage startups, Web entrepreneurs, seasonal businesses and importers to have multiple warehouses and automated order fulfillment at their fingertips. Rather than deal with the hassles of storage and shipping, why not leverage Shipwire and start spending your valuable time growing your business.

[[HINT]]
Shipwire has the unique position of being able to accept clients with competitive pricing on extraordinarily small minimums (much smaller than most other fulfillment center). 
And is a very good choice for clients who are new to fulfillment.

[[CBC]Setting up for Fulfillment with ShipWire]

<li>Log into Zoovy.com and go to the Utilities Tab.
<li>Click on Supply Chain Management.
<li>Click on Add a New Supplier.
<li>Enter supplier code (SHPWIR would be a good code, but whatever you like will work).
<li>Markup should be BASE*1.0, profile=DEFAULT
<li>Enter the Supplier Information (all except website are required).
<li>Ordering method: Select Fulfillment
<li>Data Integration Type: SHIPWIRE Fulfillment.
<li>Click SAVE. 


<li>On the next page, enter your SHIPWIRE username and password. Save. 

<li>Add your products, either one by one, or uploading a file. They can also be associated via CSV - ask your trainer for more help with this if you are uncertain how to associate products via CSV.

[[STAFF]]
csv uses the following fields:

%SKU
zoovy:virtual	 (value =SHIPWIRE:SHPWIR)
zoovy:virtual_ship (value=LOCAL) <=== to use store shipping settings
[[/STAFF]]

[[HINT]]If the SKU you have input into ShipWire is different than that which is used Zoovy, use the supplier id (zoovy:prod_supplierid) field for this alternate SKU to be sent over to ShipWire.[[/HINT]]


[[BREAK]]

Once you are integrated with ShipWire, the orders will be automatically dispatched to their interface. Tracking will also automatically come back to Zoovy for the orders. 


[[BREAK]]

[[HINT]]
The orders will NOT move from Recent to Completed automatically. This is currently the way that the integration works. If there are orders that have non-ShipWire items on them, the order will need to be split and the original order number should stay with the ShipWire items. Shipping comes over once per day, in the evening, pacific time. You will need to move the orders with tracking to completed so that the tracking emails will go out to your customers.
