<h2>Issue</h2>
Sizes not showing for ebay launches of these SKU's:

0A721D, OA718D , 0A719D, A702D

Also should be displaying free shipping, but is not.

Just a clarification, for example under the Channels tab for Sku 0a721D you see: 

8056298 ACTIVE ebay.auction 1 320175103811 Recycled 0: eBay #320175103811 45-4021 White Lace Embroider Girl Formal Gown Dress 6X 
 Insert into Launch Queue at 20071026150000 
 
8056297 ACTIVE ebay.auction 1  Insert into Launch Queue at 20071026150000 
320175103804 Recycled 0: eBay #320175103804 45-4021 White Lace Embroider Girl Formal Gown Dress 6X 
 
8056296 ACTIVE ebay.auction 1  Insert into Launch Queue at 20071026150000 
320175103797 Recycled 0: eBay #320175103797 45-4021 White Lace Embroider Girl Formal Gown Dress 6X 
 
All 3 auction titles have the size 6X when the sizes in the title should be 6, 5, and 6X

We are listing these items from scratch, but seems like the system is automatcially recycling the listing.....Still, the title shouldn't be all the same size though...

<h2>Resolution</h2>
Hi,
 Their is only one "eBay Title" field for each product. It is called "ebay:title" One of the draw backs if you are launching products to eBay that have inventoried options is that they are all utilizing the one "eBay Title" field. 

This means if you wish to display a unique eBay title for each size launched you must edit the item title during launch process for each inventoried option. 

If you have questions please contact support
