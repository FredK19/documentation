<h2>Manufacturer ID</h2>




Zoovy has a special field called "Manufacturer ID" that can be used for a variety of purposes. It can be used in place of your Zoovy Product ID when sending a supply chain order. It can be used as a part number or other unique identifier in site searches. In the future, we will be able to send your products to QuickBooks with the Manufacturer SKU instead of your Zoovy Product ID.
<br>
The Manufacturer ID field is found under the Marketplace Syndication tab of your Product Editor.
<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div> The manufacturer SKU field is found on each of your products under the Inventory section if you are using inventorial options.

<h2>Manufacturer ID and Supply Chain</h2>
Often, merchants wish to send a different Product ID or part number to their supplier than they have entered into their Zoovy accounts. This is perfect for the manufacturer SKU. However, if you are using Zoovy Supply Chain functionality, you will instead want to use the Supplier ID field, zoovy:prod_supplierid.<br>
<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div> If you wish for each of your options to have a unique manufacturer SKU that is sent to your supplier, you will need to use options that track inventory.

<h2> Manufacturer ID and QuickBooks</h2>
In Zoovy Integrated Desktop 7.0 or greater, you have the ability to push a product into QuickBooks using the Manufacturer ID instead of the usual Zoovy Product ID. This is especially useful if you have an established QuickBooks company file that uses different SKU's from those that you entered into Zoovy.
<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div> This is an all or nothing setting. You either create products in QuickBooks using your Zoovy Product ID or your Manufacturer ID. You cannot (easily) go back and forth.
