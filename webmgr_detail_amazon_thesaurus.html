<h1>Amazon Thesaurus</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

The Amazon Thesaurus Profile is a feature of the Zoovy Platform that makes it easy to create and maintain
relations between a merchants own products/categories and Amazons own Item Classification Thesaurus.<br>

When dealing with Amazon it is critical to make sure your products appear in all relevant searches on the Amazon site. 
Amazon maps user search terms to a unified "thesaurus" of words so that you don't have to specify every possible keyword a person could search for, instead you simply have to pick the appropriate words from amazon's thesaurus and set those for each product you add to Amazon. Amazon then maps every single possible word a user could search for to a specific thesaurus word.<br>
<br>
As you might imagine Amazon updates their Item Classification Guides (thesaurus) quite often in order to provide their customers with the best possible search results. To avoid the need to go through and manually update your products whenever their thesaurus changes Zoovy provides the ability to create "Thesaurus Profiles".<br>
<br>
<br>
Using thesaurus profiles dramatically reduces the time to both setup and maintain thesaurus keywords, thereby making it easier to have your products appear in more searches more often, and requiring you to spend dramatically less time managing your products keywords.<br>
