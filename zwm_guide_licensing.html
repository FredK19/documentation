<h2>Bundle/Seat Requirements</h2>


If you are interested in using Zoovy Warehouse Manager (ZWM), you are required to add the Warehouse Manager bundle.
You can do this by going to your Online Zoovy account, and go to Setup | Account Settings | Add/Remove Feature. If you are interested in installing ZWM on multiple computers, you will be required to purchase multiple seats, as well. If you are not familiar with setting up shared drives, please do not hesitate to schedule a training appointment with your Zoovy Trainer. <br><br>

<b>NOTE:</b> If Merchants plan to use ZWM on multiple computers, the Network setup is required. This involves creating a shared drive location, so that the Product Database is shared. Synchronization will only be permitted from the Primary computer. If Merchants install ZWM on multiple standalone computers, Zoovy will not support any errors/conflict/issues that may arise!
