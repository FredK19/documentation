<h2>When you need it</h2>

Zoovy mail is a service provided to Zoovy merchants who do not have SMTP support through their ISP. AOL does not provide SMTP for their email accounts.  This option should be considered as a last resort for merchants who just do not have the ability to send mail through their ISP's mail servers due to authentication or policy issues.

<h2>How to get it</h2>

<h2>POP Mail</h2>

Zoovy mail does not store POP mail on the server.  All mail you wish to save must be saved or archived on your local hard drive. You can use a mail client such as Outlook or Eudora to download your mail.
