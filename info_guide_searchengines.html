<h2>Introduction</h2>

There are professionals that literally have devoted years of study to getting top positions in the search engine.  
The bottom line is you need to accurately describe your pages and your products and include your contact information 
when submitting your website to search engines.

Please think first before signing up to a link farm or link exchange. Being connected to one of these can potentially get your website banned from search engines. We will also ban or potentially close your account for being involved with a link farm.

<h2>Overview</h2>


If you're planning on doing some serious tuning - we've got some bad news for you.
You'll find Zoovy sites are already designed to be very friendly for search engine spiders to crawl out of the box. 

We continually implement changes to rendering system and how it formats data based on
over 7 years of direct experience and the aggregate feedback of over a hundred SEO
(Search Engine Optimization) firms that have provided recommendations to our customers
at one time or another (we also have the benefit of seeing which techniques actually worked over time
and which didn't!).


<br>


In fact, we believe that a default Zoovy site is extremely well optimized out of the box,
and we regularly see our customers "before the page fold" on a variety of popular searches.
What we're trying to say is, you probably won't need to do a lot of tuning - and in fact attempting
to tune your site from the default configuration in many cases will cause you to miss out on future
enhancements.
<br>
<br>
Here are some of the default in SEO features of every Zoovy site:
<li> Zoovy reports all pages as static, even though the pages are actually dynamic -
this makes spiders more likely to crawl them.
<li> All Zoovy page layouts give the engines plenty of keyword-rich text to work with,
with the most important text being listed several times at the top.
<li> All links are easily defined (no, or little javascript)
to avoid confusing the spiders.
<li> All hyperlinks have ALT tags which specify what the link is for.
<li> All pages automatically generate meta tags in the following order: The title -- (we recommend 5-10 words including the company name and keywords), the meta name description contents � (we recommend a readable description with 20-40 words and as many keywords as possible), the meta name keywords contents � (a keyword list up to 900 characters), and other optional meta tags such as generator, etc.�
<li> Category pages are nested one level deep
e.g. http://yourname.zoovy.com/category/categorypage
By default categories pages are named with a URL friendly version of the
page name so for example a category labeled "forks" would be
http://yourname.zoovy.com/category/forks and a nested category
such as "utensils/forks" would be
http://yourname.zoovy.com/category/utensils.forks
In addition, as you rename categories, they retain their original
names so pages don't disappear (many search engines demote sites which have
links that disappear over time).
<li> All pages on Zoovy use a common wrapper, making it easy for a
search engine (specifically Google) to determine what part of the page is
actual content.
<li> All website navgiation buttons are named the same as where they go,
even when they go to categories.
<li> All product pages are nested one level deep
e.g. http://yourname.zoovy.com/product/productid
<li> All images have alt tags.

<!-- note:
we need to provide a site map
Provide a site map. A site map can make it easier for a search engine spider to find all your pages. It is basically a categorized list of all the pages on your site. There must be one or more links to the site map from the home page:

Make sure you have a text link to the site map at the bottom of the page. The text should say "Site Map," and the file should be called "sitemap.htm."

The link text should have strategic keywords where appropriate.

You should make a static list of links to all your pages, with a link to this page from the home page or the site map.

<h2>Page Properties</h2>
The page properties area of any page can be found through website builder when selecting edit.  
Click the button that says Page Properties and begin to fill in your information.  Descriptions 
should relate to the page or product and not be the same throughout your website for best results.  
Keep the title between 10 and 12 words and use commas between your keywords.

<aside class="hint">

<div>
By Default, your company name will appear in the title of every page, prior to the page specific title.  This feature can be disabled if needed.  Go to setup - checkout setup.<br>
Remove the 'website title' text box. - (try entering a space if it won't let you delete it).

<h2>Keywords</h2>

Keywords define your business, simply put they are words which people would type in to search engine to find your business. 
Good examples of keywords include your company name, your domain name, the types of products or services you sell, and any 
brand name you may carry (please be aware that certain companies may not appreciate having their trademarks in your keywords). 
For example if you sell etched rocks, you may want to put the word "etched" and then "rock" and then the types of rock you sell 
"granite, quartz, etc." if you are located in Michigan, put "Michigan", etc. Anything you can think of to find good words. 
You can also use services like overture.com (which is a good place to buy traffic for your website) to learn which words 
people search for the most. By using words which are more commonly searched for you increase the chances of people finding your site.

<aside class="caution">

Do not spend a lot of time optimizing your meta keywords, most of the major search engine dont use them anymore.  Instead, spend time on your page content and getting keywords into the body of your pages.  For every three or four times a given keyword appears, link it once to the corresponding product page.

<h2>How Long before results appear</h2>

You should allow at least 60 days for your site to appear on most major search engines. 
For faster results consider registering for Yahoo.com, and possibly buying some traffic 
from Overture.com - both are usually well worth the investment.

<h2>Meta Tags</h2>

Meta tags are used by some older search engines to determine the content a web
page to improve it's indexing. By creating a search engine registration channel
you will be able to set the default meta tags and keywords for your site. You
can also edit the meta tags on a page by page basis by going to Setup then Website
Builder, selecting a page, and clicking the Page Properties button while in page
edit mode. You can also import the keywords for a product using the CSV import,
for more information refer to the CSV import documentation.

<h2>Tuning Meta Tags - product pages</h2>

Meta tags will default to values set by by the Content Management System, but can be overwritten by specifying custom
product attributes.
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>&lt;TITLE&gt;</td>
		<td>If product/zoovy:prod_name is set, then that is used.<br>
		   company title is always pre-pended to the page title.
		 	company title is configured in Setup / Checkout Properties, if company title is not set, then
			company_name is used, which can also be configured in Setup / Checkout Properties
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>&lt;META NAME=KEYWORDS&gt;</td>
		<td>If product/zoovy:keywords is set, then that will be used. <br>
			If blank then merchant/zoovy:keywords will be loaded.<br>
			merchant/zoovy:keywords can be configured from the search engine registration channel.<br>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>&lt;META NAME=DESCRIPTION&gt;</td>
		<td>If product/zoovy:meta_description is set, then that will be used, otherwise the first the product/zoovy:prod_desc will be used. <br>
			If blank then merchant/zoovy:business_description will be loaded from merchant namespace.
			merchant/zoovy:business_description can be configured from the search engine registration channel.<br>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>&lt;META NAME=AUTHOR&gt;</td>
		<td>If company_title is set, then that will be used (company title will be defaulted to company name).<br>

<h2>Alt Tags</h2>

Nearly every image in your Zoovy store will have an alt tag associated with it.  In most cases, the alt tag is either the image filename or the product name that it is associated with.  It depends entirely on where the image is getting loaded.  For instance, in a product list (like on a category or search results page) each image is given an alt tag or the corresponding product name.  In certain category and homepage layouts (and some themes) your categories have their thumbnails displayed.  In this case, the Alt tag is generated from the category pretty name.

<br>

In layouts that have images selectable (like home and category pages) the image alt tag is typically the file location/name.  For this reason, you want to give your image folders and file names which relate to what is in the picture itself.  In the cases of products, using the manufacturer and manufacturer's ID may be a good idea (sony_DXW1020.jpg).  If a picture is going to be used in multiple places with reference to multiple products or categories, use a slightly more generic name (sony_digital_camera).

<h2>Grub Info</h2>

GRUB http://www.grub.org/ is a crawler that uses a novel distributed computing approach to crawling the Internet.
At this time you cannot install grub.txt into the root directory.
The root directory is entirely virtual, meaning the files you upload don't actually reside in a directory,
rather they exist in a database somewhere, then they are replicated across a cluster.
