<h1>API Bundle</h1>

<article>

<li> Promotions:

<h2>Scope of Support</h2>
This functionality is very advanced, and is generally unavailable in all other products. Diagnosing any technical issues related to a store that has these tools enabled will always require escalation to a senior support team member, developer, or system administrator. For these reasons we have limited the availability of this featureset to only approved customers. 

</article>

<article>
<h2>Availability</h2>
This feature is available to new customers within the first 60 days of coming onto the system and to existing customers who meet the following criteria:
<ol>
<li> Minimum Zoovy invoice of $250/mo. (If you do not meet this criteria, we can raise your monthly bill). This requirement is waived when Zoovy does the development work. 

<aside class="caution">

<div>
Zoovy Development will NOT take on overly complex projects, or projects which will likely require extended lifecycle maintenance. We reserve the right to choose not to develop your specific application, or to request you make changes to the requirements in order for us to support it. 

</div>
</aside>


<li> Regardless of who is doing the work - a project proposal and scope statement must be "approved" by Zoovy development before beginning integration. (At your request we will also provide a quote to have us build the application). 

<li> Customers will need their own web server hosted at another service provider, Zoovy does not provide application hosting. 

<li> To get started, please open a support ticket with your proposal. 
</ol>

<h2>Recommendations/Best Practices for non-Zoovy Development</h2>
In addition we have the following recommendations/best practices that will improve your success rate, and help us better support your application:
<br>

<li> Customers who do not have direct experience in software development industry should strongly consider hiring a development firm with an established track record and reputation, rather than an independent software developer who may not be able to support the application over it's lifetime. This especially applies for any module which is "critical" to the successful operation of your business. 

<li> We recommend (if possible) using the Perl language, or PHP as a backup. We have a number of developers on staff who are familiar with these languages and can (at our discretion) provide development assistance or code review. While we do not offer these services as part of our offering, it leaves the door open to us working closely with your developer to find the fastest possible solution. Also sample code is provided in Perl so this will also speed up development time and save you money.

<h2>Why we have these policies</h2>

Experience is often the best teacher.  Too often when mistakes are made during the development process the customer will request Zoovy's assistance.
For this reason we require customers adhere to these policies so that they can make more informed decisions about the best way to proceed. 
We feel it is only responsible for us to take reasonable steps to ensure your custom development project will achieve the business goals you have set for it.
