Using the Zoovy Order Manager for Windows you can add customers by going into the Customer Tool and clicking the "Create" icon.

You can import large lists of customers using the Import tool which can be found in Setup | Import Tools.

Please note that the best way to send mass email is using the Zoovy Order Manager, in this case Zoovy will automatically generate the opt-out link at the bottom of your messages and track it with their account preferences. 

If you use a 3rd party you must make sure they comply with Zoovy's very strict anti-spam rules or you run the risk of having your site suspended.
