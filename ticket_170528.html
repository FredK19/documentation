<h1>How do I Archive Orders?</h1>

<article>
<h2>Question</h2>



We have too many completed orders to be able to see all of them in Order Manager.  Is there a way to archive orders so we can clear Order Manager, but still access them?</article>

<h2>Resolution</h2>
You can actually archive orders by Logging into Zoovy, clicking on Utilities, and clicking on Archive orders under Account Utilities Section.  This allows you to Archive orders older than any selected date.  This will hide the archived orders Online, as well as in Order Manager once sync'ed.  You will still be able to search for orders by number in the Online manager.
