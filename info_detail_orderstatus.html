<h1>Order Status</h1>
<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>

When orders are created they are saved in the RECENT folder.  
While orders are in recent they can be cancelled by customers on the web.

The statuses Pending, and Approved do not mean anything to Zoovy - they are strictly for your internal use. 
Some people place orders which are waiting for payment to Pending, and orders which have been paid for to 
Approved so they can be shipped. 

Once orders are shipped they should be placed in COMPLETED status. 
Orders in completed status will appear on sales reports, etc.

Invoices will only appear in any status for 180 days. After 180 days, the only way to find the order is to look in a report, or using the search functionality.

Searching for invoices is much faster if you specify the full order number e.g. 2004-10-1234 instead of just 1234.

<h2>Cancelling Orders</h2>

When an order is cancelled it's inventory is automatically returned. 
If you un-cancel an order then you will need to manually re-adjust inventory to reflect any changes that were made to inventory as a result of that invoice. 
In addition, invoices that are sent to cancelled are not counted towards your zoovy final value fee unless you have a very high percentage of cancelled invoices (in which case all invoices count).
