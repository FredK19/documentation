<h2>Issue #159900: eBay Error #12305 during Refresh/Revise of listing</h2>

<h2>Issue</h2>
I started updating (refreshing) some of my existing listings and this is the error message I got:

<aside class="html">
<h6></h6>
<code>
Error[#12305]: The flag ThirdPartyCheckout for this item is on.
ThirdPartyCheckout is incompatible with Live Auctions, 
Ad format, Merchant Tool, Motors, and Immediate payment, however.
Revise/Relist item failed.

</code>
</aside>


I ran the Default profile and refeshed all items with that profile using:  UTILITIES > EBAY ACCOUNT SETUP > PROFILES > REFRESH LISTINGS.  I let the system do them all.  About 30% Changed and about 70% I got that error message on.

<h2>Resolution</h2>
This is probably because you've turned on auto-pay in your profile since those listings were created. This can be found in the shipping portion of your profile at:
"Ebay Account Setup" >> "Profiles" >> "((shipping)) PROFILENAME"

<br>

Auto-pay (Instant-pay) + Checkout Redirect are incompatible. If a listing was launched without auto-pay you can't revise the listing and add it - since Zoovy has tagged the listing for checkout redirect (which unfortunately can't be removed once it's been added)
