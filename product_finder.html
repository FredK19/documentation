<h1>Product Finder</h1>



<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>
The Product Finder is an interface that allows you to easily view the products currently associated with a category or list, and add, remove, or rearrange the order of the products displayed in that category or list area.  You can get to the Product Finder interface via several areas, such as Page Layout/Product Lists, Product Editor/Cross Selling, or Setup/Categories and Lists.

<div> Currently there is a known issue with the Product Finder interface that will only allow you to make one change per session.  You can add/remove/or move one product, "Save" your modification, then perform another modification if so desired without problem. See also : <a class="linkdoc" href="#?doc=50702">Doc 50702</a>

<h3>Product Finder Options</h3>
<li> CURRENT - displays the products associated with the selected category or list, as well as their relative order.  You can use the up/down arrows next to each product to change the display order of the products within that category/list.
<li> RECENT - displays all Products created/edited in last 24 hours.
<li> SHOW ALL - displays up to 350 Products.
<li> FROM LIST - displays Products from any custom list that you have created previously.
<li> FROM CATEGORY - displays Products from any category that you have created previously.
<li> MORE CHOICES - this option is very useful for finding a product in a variety of way, including by Manufacturer, Supplier, Management Category, Title, PID (SKU), or by last 250 products created.
<li> TEXT/SEARCH - this option is a little confusing at first.  The Text Box labeled "TEXT:" works in conjunction with the button below it labeled "SEARCH".  These can be used to search for any products.  Search results are dependent upon how you have your Search Catalogues configured.
<li> TEXT/LOAD CSV - this option can be used to load a list of products by PID(SKU) number.  Simply place all the product PID(SKU) numbers for the products you want listed in the Text Box, separated by a comma, and click on the "LOAD CSV" button.  For example: Prod123,Prod456,Prod789.
