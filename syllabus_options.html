<h1>Syllabus: Options (Optional)</h1>

<h3>Product Option Groups</h3>
Product Options are created in the product, under the Config Options button. Use product options when you've got a unique choice that only applies to one product. E.g. if the product UFO has one option group "Discomboluator" which has two options "Nuclear" and "Coal", and no other products in your store have Discombobulators then using a Product Option group is the best choice.

<h3>Store Option Groups</h3>
Store Options are built under Products > Store Option Groups. 
If you sell similar types of products then the majority of your options should be Store Option Groups. 
</section>

<section>
<h3>System Wide Option Groups</h3>
System Wide Options are preconstructed options built by Zoovy for your convenience. They are found under Products > Store Option Groups.
</section>

<h3>Inventory</h3>
If you select "Yes," you will be tracking inventory by the different choices that are available for that option. For example, if you had a shirt that came in different sizes and you wanted to track how many of the small sizes you had versus how many of the large or extra-large, you would make the option effect Inventory.
