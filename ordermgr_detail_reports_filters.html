<h1>Reports - Filters</h1>
<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>

Filters allow you to control which data appears on a report. Using a combination of filters in a specific order you 
can craft a dashboard that displays virtually any metric you'd like about your business.
Filters can be saved.

<h2>How Filters Work</h2>

To create a filter you simply select one or more filters from the list of Available Filters (each filter is described in
detail below), in order for a particular order to be included on the report it must match every filter added.

<h2>Adding Filters</h2>

Simply select a filter from the list of Available Filters, provide the necessary addition criteria (e.g. if you select
order total you will need to enter it if you want order totals greater than, or less than a certain amount). 
Once you have added a filter you can remove it from the list of filters by selecting it in the list of Current Filters 
and clicking the "Remove" button.

<h2>Available Filters</h2>

<li> Order Total - the order total reflects the grand total of the order, including all items plus tax, shipping, handling,
and any speciality payment fees. When selecting this filter you will be required to specify if you want to include orders
over a specific dollar amount, or under a specific dollar amount.
<li> Payment Method - the payment method filter allows you to include only orders paid using a certain method, such as 
paypal or credit card.
<li> Created Date - the created date of the order is when the order was placed on the website.

<li> Paid Date - the paid date of the order is when the order was originally marked as paid (even if the payment
was later refunded, the original payment date will still be retained and the order will appear) -- 
however orders must be marked as paid to be included.
Orders that are not marked as paid will not be included - unless the date field is left blank. 
If the date field is left blank then only UNPAID orders will appear in the report.


<li> Ship Date - the ship date of the order is set to the date the first package was shipped in the order. 
For this reason if your reports rely heavily on multi-date shipments (packages shipped across many days) we recommend
you split orders so that each order's ship date can be tracked independently to ensure accurate reporting. 
Orders that have not been shipped (or where shipping #'s were not provided will not be included - unless the date field is left blank. 
If the date field is left blank then only UN-SHIPPED orders will appear in the report.
As long as you utilize either the built-in UPS, FedEx or DaZzle integration the shipped date will always be set correct.y

<li> Marketplace - this value allows you to specify one or more marketplaces which can be included. 
0 - storefront sales only, 1 - ebay, 2 - ebay store, 4 - ebay motors, 8 - aol, 32 - amazon
64 - froogle, 128 - pricegrabber, 256 - bizrate, 512 - shopping deal, 1024 - overstock.com<br>
<br>
If you want to have multiple marketplaces included, simply add the values together. E.g. if you wanted both ebay
and ebay stores you would add 1+2 and use a value of "3" -- several of the marketplace numbers do not track yet, this is
something we are still working on implementing (ebay and aol do - the others will be arriving shortly)<br>
<br>

<li> Shipping Method - this field allows you to sort by type of shipping that the customer selected. This should be the 
exact shipping description that appears in the order. You may specify multiple shipping values by simply separating them
by commas. 

<li> Order Status - this allows you to enter one or more order statuses that should be included. You may enter any 
of the following values: RECENT, PENDING, APPROVED, COMPLETED, CANCELLED, BACKORDER, ARCHIVE

<li> New Customers - this field tracks customers where this is the first time purchasing from your store.
The customers are grouped by email address, so if a customer changes their email address then they will be recorded as
a new customer.

<li> Repeat Customers - this field tracks customers which have purchased from you before.

<li> Product Price - in this field you will be able to enter an amount, and also specify if orders greater than or less
than the amount should be included. Only one product in the order needs to match the filter criteria for the entire 
order to be included.

<li> Destination State - In this you may specify one or more two letter state codes. To specify multiple states simply
separate them by commas.

<li> Supplier - this field you will enter the product supplier. This field is stored in the product field zoovy:prod_supplier.
To be includdd in the report an order must have one or more items from the selected manufacturer(s). To specify multiple 
suppliers simply use commas (note: supplier names must NOT contain commas, if they do, then it won't work)
<li> Manufacturer - in this field you will enter the product manufacturer name. This field is stored in 
zoovy:prod_mfg in the products. To be included in the report an order must have one or more items from the
selected manufacturer(s). To specify multiple manufacturers simply use commas (note: manufacturer names should NOT 
contain commas, if they do, then it won't work)

<li> DEBUG - the problem with a dashboard report is you can't see exactly which data is included on the report.
If you believe a particular report is questionable you can add the DEBUG filter. The debug filter does not actually
cause orders to be included or not included, but it does the application to write out a debug file named 
"debug.txt" -- you may look in this file to see why/how specific orders were included or excluded.

<h2>Saving</h2>

You may save filters for each recall in the future, that way you can use the same reports over and over again. If you use
dates they will also be saved in the filter, so you will need to edit the filter before running it.

<h2>Future Development</h2>

The ability to filter is still a relatively new feature for us. 
We have plans to add even more fields and capabilities to this, this is merely a first release to see if the functionality
is useful and to gauge customer demand.
We encourage you to provide feedback and to ask questions.
