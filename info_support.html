<h1>Help! Guide to Zoovy Support</h1>

<article>
<h2>Support Overview</h2>

This document provides useful tips to improve your experience with Zoovy support.
It also outlines specific practices which will directly enhance or detract from your 
Zoovy e-commerce experience.

<br>

The first thing to keep in mind when requesting assistance is that Zoovy is your partner in success. We benefit from your success and we want to help you. But, we expect to be treated with the same level of professionalism and respect that you expect from us. Zoovy prides itself in getting you the answer as quickly as possible once we get all the information we need to diagnose the problem. 

We answer the tickets in the order and priority that the tickets come into support. 
If your support ticket does not follow our suggestions it will delay your ticket getting attention. 

We will send the ticket back to you asking for more information. Once you respond to our questions and return the ticket your ticket will be at the end of the line. 

This is why it is so important to provide us all the details when you first open the ticket.

<h3>Opening a support Ticket</h3>
The most common way to contact support is to open a electronic support ticket.

There are a couple of tricks to opening up a support ticket to ensure that you get quick and proficient help. Please make sure that your support ticket has all the suggestions below and you will have a faster turnaround time.

When creating a support ticket, please provide specific examples and the
necessary steps to recreate the issue if they are known.

We need the exact steps you took when you encountered the bug, not just an overview of the steps. If you neglect to provide all steps then we may have a different ending result than you and this will delay arriving at a solution. Examples and steps are very important. 
They give support a starting point in troubleshooting your issue. If something in your store or products is not correct let us know, but don't forget to explain how it should look or what the correct price should be to the best of your ability.

<h3>Opening a Call Back Support Ticket</h3>
When creating a call back ticket, a technician will respond to your ticket
much quicker than if you do not create a call back ticket. You should not
create a call back ticket for minor issues. By creating a call back ticket
you will be billed a minimum of 10 minutes. The call back ticket is not designed
for troubleshooting your issue over the phone unless you have the money to spend for the time you have a support rep on the phone. When creating a call back
ticket, please include all pertinent information. This should include your
exact click by click steps to recreate the issue if applicable. Please do
not say use any product or channel. Give a specific example at all times
when applicable. Basically follow the same guidelines as if you were creating a support ticket as stated above.

<h3>Duplicate Tickets/Grouped Issue Tickets</h3>
Please only open ONE ticket per issue.  Duplicate tickets reduce ticket response time as support resources are divided and multiple techs are working on the same problem.  This in turn impacts the efficiency and speed by which we can offer you response and resolution to your issues. Opening duplicate tickets will NOT get your issue handled quicker.<br>
Please only submit ONE issue per ticket. Opening a support ticket with multiple issues greatly increases the likelihood that one or more of your issues may "fall through the cracks" and not get the response that it deserves.  In addition is causes confusion and decreases response clarity when the tech is working on your ticket. It's very easy with multiple issues per ticket for the tech to be addressing one issue and the merchant to think they are talking about a different issue in the same ticket.

<h3>Billing Issues</h3>

billing@zoovy.com

<div> Caps (uppercase) is commonly used to add emphasis to specific words such as "NO" or "NOT" to make them stand out. At no time should you create a support ticket with all caps. This is interpreted as yelling and is highly disrespectful and many employees will pass on your ticket since they will not want to deal with you.

<div> Your "How To" questions should be directed to an implementation specialist via a training appointment. If you open up a support ticket with a "How To" question chances are we will direct you to schedule training. If our support queue fills up with "How To" questions than this delays us from answering and troubleshooting tickets that are reporting bugs in our software

Just like any business we reserve the right to refuse service to anyone. If senior management becomes aware of an inappropriate ticket or phone conversation we have a variety of actions that we can take: these actions include warnings, temporarily or permanent access privilege loss, and even asking you to leave the system and terminating your account. 
Zoovy is based in San Diego, CA. - we compete with a variety of well funded companies for the best and brightest talent and we will not be able to retain the best staff if customers make this a hostile work environment.
