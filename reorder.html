<h1>Reorder Option</h1>



<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>

Merchants can give customers the option of reordering one of their previous orders by selecting the Enable re-order feature in customer order status feature at Setup > Customer Admin Config.

<h2>Changes to options groups can cause unexpected results</h2>
Changes in price modifiers, weight modifiers or the base price on a SKU will be recognized
and automatically updated in the new order. However, if a merchant makes changes to the structure of the options in a group, the customer may order something different than they were expecting.<br>
<br>
Consider the following scenario:<br>
<br>
OLD SKUs:<br>
<br>
ABC123:A00 = Red<br>
ABC123:A01 = White<br>
ABC123:A02 = Blue<br>
<br>
New SKUs are created after the supplier's names are changed for colors. The new color list  mixes in different colors.<br>
<br>
ABC123:A00 = Ivory<br>
ABC123:A01 = Forest Green<br>
ABC123:A02 = Scarlet<br>
<br>
If the customer had ordered ABC123:A00 previously and now they are re-ordering,
they click the re-order button and the system recognizes the SKU ABC123:A00 =
Ivory. Zoovy will choose the product based on SKU, not the name of the
color. So, when the customer receives a ABC123:A00 = Ivory product, they may be
upset that they got a white one instead of a red. The updated name will appear
on the invoice, however, customers don't always read the fine print.<br>
<br>
Also, SKUs that have been deleted will be removed from the new order. An error
message warns the customer of this, but if the customer is not paying attention
they might miss that the item is not present in their new cart.<br>
<br>
Merchants considering activating this feature are encouraged to try it out with test orders and changing products until they feel comfortable with the decision.<br>
