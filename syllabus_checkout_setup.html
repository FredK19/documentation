<h3>Display Shipping Total in Cart</h3>
This choice can affect the calculation of shipping. It can also streamline the checkout process for a customer.


Most customers are going to quote some kind of shipping in the cart. If he or she is not going to ever quote shipping, the first choice is applicable. If the customer uses a Fixed Rate, Simple Shipping, Weight-Based Shipping, or Price-Based Shipping, he or she can safely quote without Zip Code. In this case, the location of the customer is irrelevant. If our customer is quoting Fed Ex, UPS, DHL or USPS, the location that is being shipped to is pivotal. In this case, the customer will want to require a Zip Code in order to get his or her shipping quote.
