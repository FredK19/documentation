[[SECTION]Concept Overview]
[[TAG]word=1000]

This award-winning customer reviews solution is designed to be easy and affordable for small to medium-sized online retailers.  Zoovy and Power Reviews have executed a strategic agreement to integrate our technologies. Power Reviews is now considered a "supported application" for members of the Best Partner Practice program and Zoovy support will begin offering integration support for the application immediately.
[[SUBSECTION]Why choose Power Reviews?]
Power Reviews Express makes it easy to collect reviews.  In using Power Reviews, you will have access to the following functionality:<br>
<br>
<li>Pre-formatted review forms are easy for your customers to complete. You get access to over 2500 relevant, product-specific review forms to choose from.
<li>Images, videos and blogs are easy for customers to upload and add to their review comments with a single click.
<li>Full Content Moderation is included â€“ each review is read by a trained PowerReviews Express moderator and screened for inflammatory and non-product-related content.

PowerReviews Express is the same robust solution used by Staples, Toys "R" Us, and REI. It recently won the 2009 Best Site Merchandising Tool Award from Small Business Computing Excellence in Technology.
[[HINT]] Since you're reading this document, you're probably considering using Power Reviews.  You should be aware that Power Reviews is not currently viewable over a secure connection.<br>
Directly from Power Reviews:   The PowerReviews Express solution utilizes a CDN to host review data/assets.  The PowerReviews CDN does not support HTTPS requests at this time.
(01/05/11)<br>
Since PCI regulations now require that once a session goes secure, it must remain secure for the duration of the session.  This means that for any shopper that logs into a customer account, none of the PowerReview data will display.
