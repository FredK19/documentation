<h1>Auction Etiquette</h1>
<article>
<h2>Assisting Bidders</h2>

If a bidder has any questions that have not answered in your product's description, they can e-mail you for more information. To be as professional as possible, answer these questions in a prompt and formal manner.  Not doing so will turn away interested bidders. Check your e-mail frequently during an auction to ensure that an individual has sufficient time to bid.

<h2>Item Description</h2>

You can add information to an item's description at anytime during an auction. So, if bidders seem to be asking the same questions about an item, you can add the answer to your description.

<h2>Closing The Auction Early</h2>

If you are not getting the desired response or have changed your mind about selling an item, you can end an auction before the specified closing date.  However, you must remove each person who has bid on the item, one at a time. Depending on the number of bids received, this can be a tedious endeavor.  You do not want to use this feature unless you absolutely have to.  In accordance with proper etiquette, be sure to alert bidders as to the reason for the early close.

<h2>Completing The Sale</h2>

Once the auction has ended, Zoovy will automatically e-mail the winner a URL link, taking him or her to your Zoovy store for checkout. Once they have arrived at your online store, the item will be in their shopping cart, and they will have the added benefit of shopping for additional products. 
Zoovy is unique in that it automatically contacts the auction winners, enabling you to concentrate on selling.  When an auction closes, Zoovy will place the item in a shopping cart, take the winner to your Zoovy store, and process the credit card or other payment method at checkout.  You merely have to process the order and ship the product.

<h2>Feedback</h2>

When an auction winner comes to your site to complete the transaction, he or she can leave you important feedback.  Additionally, you have the ability to leave buyers feedback as well.  Feedback can be very powerful.   It can deter bidders from participating in your future auctions. It can also deter sellers from dealing with various buyers if they have developed a bad reputation. Remember, no one likes to do business with someone that has received a lot of negative feedback.  Below are some suggestions for avoiding negative feedback.

<li>Ship the product in a timely manner.  Inform the customer when the product has been shipped and the method used, providing a tracking number when available. 
<li>You are only human, and inevitably you will make a mistake.  If you receive some negative feedback, take immediate action to remedy the situation. 
<li>If you are at fault, strive to make amends with the customer as soon as possible. Often times, however, it is not possible to make everyone happy all of the time, especially when doing a high volume of business.  
<li>Try to make a disgruntled customer happy by including free overnight shipping and/or offering a ten percent discount on the next order. Remember, you are a professional.  Always respond in a polite, professional manner.
<li>If you are a new user and have yet to receive a great deal of positive feedback, you must work extra hard to build your "portfolio."  Having a large amount of positive feedback is a powerful way of attracting customers. 
<li>If you are a new user and have received primarily negative responses your business will likely suffer.  This may require you to start fresh by establishing a new account.  Or, you can work diligently to rebuild your reputation, which may be a very difficult task.
<li>If you are constantly receiving complaints because packages are arriving late or damaged, consider rethinking your shipping policy, Remember, Zoovy essentially handles everything for you except the shipping and handling of products.
<li>Be gracious.  If you have a positive experience with a customer, give him or her positive feedback.  This is an easy way to generate repeat business and build solid customer relations.
