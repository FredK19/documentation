<h2>Ebay Account Setup Training</h2>















Integrating your Zoovy account with your eBay account is easy but with tons of versatility to sell in the manner you are used to. If you are an eBay seller, taking advantage of Zoovy to launch to eBay is usually a great idea. We can increase your upsell with items from your Zoovy webstore and add winning bidders to your newsletter subscriber list. Ultimately, we can bring the customers that we find off of eBay back to your Zoovy store rather than eBay. If you are not currently an eBay seller, you might want to consider this popular marketplace as another venue for customer acquisition.
<br>
This is an optional training, only required for customers that intend to use EBay as a marketplace.

<h6>Multiple User Ids on eBay</h6>
<div>While you can set up multiple user ids with Zoovy for selling on eBay, this may not be the best practice for your business. We suggest, rather, that the focus be more on your webstore and diversifying your business to other sales channels to become less focused on eBay, so that your business can grow.
