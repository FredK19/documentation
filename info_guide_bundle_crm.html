<h2>Subscribe to Mailing List</h2>

Zoovy allows customers to create accounts in your store.
Those accounts are used to track their preferences and determine if they would like to receive email from you. <br><br>

By default customers create accounts during checkout,
however this behavior can be changed by going to Setup | Checkout Properties. <br><br>

If you do not have customer accounts enabled during checkout then
customers must subscribe by going to the mailing list sign up page.
Customers may find this page by clicking the "Feedback" or "Contact Us" button on your site.
If you wish to provide a separate link you can simply send customers to <br>
http://yourname.zoovy.com/subscribe.cgis
