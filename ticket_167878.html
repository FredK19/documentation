Hello Muhammad,

We have received your questionnaire regarding the Express custom work that we'll be doing for you.  Everything seems to be in order and I have forwarded it on to a member of our design team.  The design usually takes 5 to 10 working days to put together.  
Once it is ready, I will update this ticket with a link to the design at which point I'll request a pass or fail.  You can read more about the process at the following page in webdoc:

http://webdoc.zoovy.com/doc/50895

If you have any questions please respond to this support ticket.

Thank you,

Hello Muhammad,

The design is ready for your approval.  You can see the preview under express site design.

At this point, we need a pass/fail on the design.  A 'pass' will put us in to construction right away and we'll have the store built in 5-10 business days.  A 'fail' could lead to a couple different options, which are outlined at the following page in webdoc:

http://webdoc.zoovy.com/doc/50895

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thank you,

Hi,
FAILED !
I only have problem with the FONT used !
And the brown color. 
I would rather have the colors of the net-a-porter site and the fonts from there as well.
It need to look MODERN and contemporary. Right now it looks ANTIQUE. Please take a look at the NET-a-PORTER website.
Best Regards

Hello,

My name is JT and I am the Lead Designer here at Zoovy. I wanted to take this opportunity to thank you for your recent purchase and get you started on the track to having your custom work completed.

In order to determine which Zoovy designer would be best suited for your project, it would help if we could have a short conversation. At your convenience, please log in to the scheduler and book a 15 minute appointment with me. During this conversation we can talk about what was purchased and the design needs/desires for the project and also to make sure expectations are properly set.

You can prepare for this meeting by being able to provide some examples of your existing site and/or eBay auction template and also some example sites/templates of what you would like your project to look like. You can get a lot of design ideas from templatemonster.com, just make a note of any template IDâ€™s.

If you would like to add that information to this ticket prior to our conversation, then I can look it over and be more prepared. Any design related information that you would like to pass along would be helpful.

An outline for the custom work process can be found in our online documentation system (webdoc) at the following link:

      http://webdoc.zoovy.com/doc-50853

Hello JT,
I have scheduled a meeting for the 17th at 9am.
The website that I really like is Net-a-porter.com
here is the link to their homepage. http://www.net-a-porter.com/am/Home.ice

its clean, modern and simple to use.
I want to have a contemporary look. The FONTS used and FOnt Sizes are Important. colors need to be minimal and focus should remain on the pictures of the products we are selling.
I hope this helps you to get some idea. We can discuss this more next thursady.
Best Regards
MO

Hello,

The preview for the homepage is ready.  Preview:   	3345-CSTM_WRAPPER---rev-1.jpg  	  (in attachments section).  I like it.  

Depending on how many top level categories you want across the top, we may want to move the search to make room.

The banners are all placeholders and we'd swap them with your actual products as we get closer.

The three banners across the bottom would appear on every page as part of the footer.  The middle one is a placeholder that we can populate once you give us some idea what you might want there.

Let me know what you think.

Thanks,

JT

hey jt,
its much better than before, I think we are getting pretty close.
Here are some comments,

1) the first opeing page should have just ONE picture (or banner) as you are calling it. There is still a LOT of clutter on the page.

2) All the Need Assistance or news letter banners should be removed from the page. Need assitance info etc. should be under "COntact US". We donot need a Banner for that on the front page.

3) Hacker Safe should also be moved from the top right corner to the bottom of the page.

4) Search should definitely be moved from the current position. As that line should have the categories only.

5) I am still not too crazy about the font. specially on the logo.
I would like to remove the "image of the bull" from the name "terracottaOnweb.com".
and just use the font there. The font used by net-a-porter is still much better than what we are using. Can we please change that.
furthermore, the font used in the LOGO/Name and otherwise in the website should be ONe. We donot want to use multiple fonts. It is too distracting.

The LOGO should be in black and White not in color. A faded image of the logo in light gray can be used as a WALL PAPER/background, on the frontpage. With just ONE large BANNER on top, which will showcase just One product image. That image in the banner can  be changed every week to make the website seem fresh for repeat customers.

We donot have use the logo with the name TerracottaOnweb.com. As that takes away from the contemporary look that we are trying for. And also the full name TerracottaOnweb.com should be used. Not just TerracottaOnweb

Please let me know if all this makes sense. 
If you need to call to discuss this. Please do, my cell is 646 256 0929
Muhammad.

Hello,

I have forwarded this information on to the designer.

My comments
1.  No problem.  If you want to give us the content/subject matter of the banner, I can have my designer work up a graphic.  Note that the package you purchased does not include us coming up with weekly graphics for you.

3.  Moving hackersafe from the header will dramatically reduce it's effectiveness.  

Thanks,

JT

hi,
the graphic is not going to change every week. there is going to be Only a Product picture on the front page. and I will only replace that product picture with a New/different product every week or ten days.
the graphic actually will be either the Terracotta LOGO bull (faded in light gray in the background. Or We can use one of the Hierlographic Symbols from the LOGO (again faded in gray) and use that as the graphic background for the front page. Depending on how the designer uses either the bull or the hierographic symbols, It can LOOk very Modern and Contemporary.
With that as the GRAPHIC , we will have a Large (One product Image) on the front page . Which I should be able to change. The background GRAPHICs will NOT change. 
I hope this clarifies. What we are trying to achieve.

I would still like to move the Hackersafe Logo to the Bottom of the page.
It is too distracting in the top right corner.

If you need to call me , my cell is 646 256 0929.

Best Regards
Muhammad

rcvd preview from jigar.  Sent back with these changes.

homepage:

Also, move the cart total to below the four links in the upper right corner and above the search.

For the second banner, I like it.  Remove the 'rollover to see details' and make the second picture alpha'd back like the other three.  Remove 'THE' and have it just say "Customer Favorites"


Ebay store header:
Remove the cart running total.
Change links in upper right corner to: "About | Policies | Contact"
Change links in black bar to: "New Arrivals | Ending Soon | Auctions Only | Buy it Now!"


Auction template
add links in upper right corner for "About | Policies | Contact"
Remove the two text boxes at the bottom.  
remove the ecommerce by zoovy.
Change the 'bid | buy item' to 'Bid on/Buy item'

Remove the link under the picture for 'more related...'
Add three more thumbnails under the main picture.

the TerracottaOnWeb.com font is not nice .. Please ask the designer not to use any Sci Fi looking fonts. I like s simple Arial kinda font. 
Secondly, the name needs to be written with a capital " O " , so that it is easy to read. Terracottonweb.com is very confusing to read versus TerracottaOnweb.com which is easier. I would appreciate if they make the "O" bigger. 

Not too crazy about the "turned page" look of the picture at the bottom right corner.

How many pictures are going to be on the page ?
There is one main picture (with the girl /coat) ,then there are four small thumbnail pics of different products. that is a total of FIVE pics on the main page. 
I am not sure about the metal/leather sofas ? Is that a permanent grapic ? or is that going to be a picture as well ?
If its a pictures , where is the border ? I cannot see it. It seems superimposed. Not sure, how will I be able to put a super imposed picture there. Please explain. 

apart from these above comments , the page looks fine.

the auction page looks nice. however, as i commented on the homepage. The logo font needs to be redone, and the "O" needs to be bigger. 
Furthermore, I want to be able to put FULL five pictures of the product on auction. there seems to be one picture missing.
Please add the extra (fifth) picture as well.

Hello,

3345-CSTM_WRAPPER---rev-2.jpg

banners - I was going to set this up as two banners, one for 'best dressed' and the bottom, though it looks like four, would just be one that would link to a favorites page.  I can set the bottom one up so that it pulls four products in to the four places if you want on the left.  The two couches on the right would be hardcoded if that was the case.  I can change the couches to a different graphic if you prefer (please supply image).

logo - I had them do a few tweaks on your logo as a courtesy, however no logo work was purchased as part of this project.  The logo will be loaded automatically from the 'company information' page so you will have control over what appears there.  In the meantime, I will have them leave the current logo as a sample of the size that will be present.  If you would like us to rework your logo for you, let me know and I'll have Matt give you a call.

3349-CSTM_AUCTION---rev-1.jpg
 - the logo will also be choosable through the interface, so you'll have control here.
 - the auction template will support more images, no problem.  Only four were shown.

Let me know about the homepage functionality.  I can have them remove the 'peel' effect, no problem.  

Thanks,

JT

Hi,
okay, forget about the logo.
We are NOT going to use any image. No Bull No Hierlograpnics etc. So no image linkage etc. will be needed anywhere.
Just change the FONT for TerracottaOnweb.com on the top left corner. With NO sci fi fonts .. just a regular ARIAL kinda font will be fine. With a link to the homepage. So every time you move to the cursor to the name of TerracottaOnweb.com it will be an alive connection that will take us back to the homepage. We will keep that on every page.

TWO COUCHES
A hard coded image like that will not work. I actually want to be able to change all images on the homepage. Please suggest an alternative to that.

I do have a question about the WORDS on the images. How will they be controlled ? e.g The word Best Dressed etc. (how will that be changed)? 

The categories on the top menu will be more, so , if you can add a few more options there, it will be great.

Best regards
MO

Hello,

The categories across the top will be pulled from the website builder. As long as you have under 9 (or so) and they're not too long, it'll be fine.

homepage - 
The text is part of the graphic.  Changing it will require an application such as photoshop.

For the bottom image, to give you the control you want and flexibility, I think the best solution would be to remove the two couches on the right and to make the product thumbnails a little bigger and support up to six (or so) of them, spanning the width.  Those pics will be controlled through a product list, making it easy for you to change them out.

Let me know.

Hi,
 It is a little difficult to decide without seeing what  might  work. I am not sure. 
We can try to see it with six images, or we can also test without any small images. or we can see it with four images (just done a little bigger) or we can look at an alternative .

so just to understand the photoshop part. The image to be used will be photoshop adjusted by me, and then placed into the main page. That will be fine. No Problem there.

Called and talked to Muhammad.

He likes the most recent preview.
The homepage needs to have some banner placeholders on it to give the customer some variety down the road.  
Beneath the big banner, and a two column banner arrangement.  
Below the product list, add a three column banner arrangement.

Hello,

1.  you'll be able to set the logo as you need.
2.  The banners will appear only if you turn them on.  It is easy through the interface to enable/disable the banners.
3.  Yes, I will have the peel removed.
4.  There is no simple interface for changing the colors, you would need to modify the templates themselves, which are all written in HTML and TOXML (our proprietary language), but you do have access to the templates once my part of the project is finished.

Thanks,

I am waiting to talk to Mat about the inside (product page) layout . (I have left a few messages for him)
a) I was under the impression that all the pages will be customized. If that is not the case , 
b) Can I see the final home page without the PEEL and with our LOGO (without the bar, it is currently loaded on the zoovy site)

c) I would  still like to see  how the product pages will look like with our new home page layout, wrapper, before we finalize the Design. So, Once I get the final draft of the homepage. I will try to see the Wrapper on the inside pages (product pages) If It looks good there as well, then we are done. And ready to move on.

I really appreciate your effort in this matter.
