<h2>About Custom Files</h2>

Custom files are files stored outside the image library and cannot be automatically resized. The purpose of the custom files directory is to store files such as word docs, pdf's or small audio/video files that you have available for download.  You can also use this folder to store files such as Flash or animated gifs which are not compatible with the image library. Also, all images used in a custom theme should be uploaded into this directory.
