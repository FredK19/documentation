<h2>Unable to copy and paste in Mozilla Firefox browser</h2>

<br>

When using the Mozilla Firefox browser. I am unable to right click and copy/paste. I receive the message "Unpriviledged scripts cannot access cut/copy/paste
programatically for security reason."
I can copy/paste on other sites.
I have no problem when using Internet Explorer
<br>
This is a common issue with Mozilla Browsers and is not unique to Zoovy. Often using the keyboard shortcuts will bypass this issue. Ctrl C copies. Ctrl V pastes.
