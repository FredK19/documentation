<h2>Associating with a Product</h2>

You can assign a product to an Option Group by selecting the the product and dragging
it onto the Option Group that you would like it to be a part of. Once you have added the product to the
option group it becomes a product option group or for short a POG. <br>

Once you have added a product to an option group, you will need to fine tune the
option group for that product.
