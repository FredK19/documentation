READ THIS -- URGENT UPDATES THAT IMPACT YOU - FRAUD ADVISORY.<br>
<br>
Dear Valued Zoovy Customers,
<br>
In the past few weeks several unscrupulous marketing firms and/or identity thieves
have been targeting our member base. Many of these people are posing to be a 
Zoovy Employee, or claiming that their companies are somehow related or affiliated 
with.<br>
<br>
<b>THAT IS NOT THE CASE.</b><br>
<br>
We do not share your information with anybody except our authorized partners - and even then only when we are working with them on a joint project we believe you will be interested in. 
Authorized Partners ALWAYS have a page in the Zoovy documentation system.
Unfortunately there is really nothing to stop anybody from simply claiming to be an employee of an authorized company.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately it is now apparent at least one of these companies was nothing more than criminals looking to get enough information to gain access to businesses to perform 
actions such as credit card fraud and/or identity theft of YOU and YOUR CUSTOMERS. 
After some consideration due to the success of security attacks such as 
phishing we implemented secureKey as a mechanism to thwart this problem. <br>
<br>
In the past these criminals used actual phone calls attempting to sell what appear to be legitimate business services in order to solicit usernames and passwords from our clients.
<br>
This is a new and VERY scary form of attack. In several cases the individuals have
been given access to the Zoovy store - and the stores may have been compromised and their checkouts were trojaned, and/or order history was downloaded.<br>
<br>
In response to this threat - Zoovy has implemented a new security protocol - 
intended to thwart anybody who is claiming to be an authorized partner.<br>
<br>
Anybody who contacts you on behalf of Zoovy in the future will be able to provide
you an AUTHORIZED SECURITY CODE. To check a security code simply login to your
Zoovy.com account and type in the code provided by the vendor. 
If it is a valid authorization code - then details about the partner will appear. 
If it it is NOT a valid authorization - then instructions are provided on how to inform us of this security breach so we can inform the proper law enforcement authorities. <br>
<br>
Authorization codes are short 6 digit alphanumeric character sequences that are given to Zoovy 
employees and other marketplace vendors who might contact you on our behalf. <br>
<br>
<b>IF THE INDIVIDUAL ON THE OTHER END OF THE PHONE DOES NOT HAVE AN AUTHORIZATION CODE
IT MEANS THEY ARE ATTEMPTING TO GAIN YOUR TRUST BY MISREPRESENTING THEIR RELATIONSHIP 
WITH OUR COMPANY. ALL AUTHORIZED PARTNERS HAVE ACCESS TO AN EXTRANET WHERE THEY CAN LOOKUP AUTHORIZATION CODES BY ONLY KNOWING YOUR USERNAME.</b><br>
<br>
IF YOU HAVE GIVEN ANYBODY YOUR USERNAME AND/OR PASSWORD PLEASE CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD
IMMEDIATELY. WE ARE AWARE OF SEVERAL CUSTOMERS WHO HAVE HAD THEIR ENTIRE CUSTOMER
AND ORDER DATABASE DOWNLOADED.

<h2>How this system works:</h2>

Both Zoovy and the legitimate partners that we work with have access to generate valid 
authorization codes. All Zoovy partners should have a valid code on file before they contact you. 
Anybody who claims to be representing Zoovy or in anyway affiliated with Zoovy and does not 
have a valid security code is most likely lying.

</article>
<article>
<h2>What this means</h2>


You should *NEVER* give anybody access to your store who you do not implicitly trust. 
Virtually any amount of access can be exploited into something which can literally destroy your business. 
For example even giving a search engine optimization company access to tune keywords on your site - 
can let them also embed malicious code into your site that breaks into your customers computer, 
then intercepts and transmits the credit card numbers back to them.
Malicious hackers are even using sophisticated telephone boiler rooms with cracked 
VoIP phones to "social engineer" this information - it's nearly untracable. 
A single store can often net them hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue in just a few hours -
easily 10 or 20x what even the most sucessful phishing scam nets. 
Unfortunately it's a dangerous world we live in, you really can't be too paranoid.

<h2>How codes are issued</h2>

Authorization codes are unique to a Zoovy account and vendor combination, 
they are based on an algorithim that uses two independent shared secrets 
a long with a secret encoding algorithim making it impossible to guess 
or share across accounts.

</article>
<article>
<h2>Who has authorization codes</h2>

Zoovy takes great care to ensure the legitimacy of our partners and their offerings. 
We reserve the right to share information with our partners after they have demonstrated
to us that their product works, and that it will be beneficial for the majority of our
customers (or at least the demographic they are accessing.) <br>
<br>
Together Zoovy merchants form a strong community of intelligent business owners that 
process millions of dollars in sales each month. We encourage all our merchants to 
utilize this system - by doing this you protect the entire community - since hackers 
are less likely to target our userbase if they believe most or all attacks will be 
thwarted and repeated.<br>
<br>
In all circumstances the partner will also be listed on our list of all partners 
which is available from the zoovy.com homepage.

<h2>Additional Safety Tips: SPAM</h2>

NEVER buy from a vendor who spammed you. Literally like 2 out of 3 are scams. 
Legitimate businesses do not send email spam - ever.

<article>
<h2>Additional Safety Tips: Forged Links in Email</h2>

Finally - as you are probably already aware links in emails can be forged. 
For this reason Zoovy and our partners will *NEVER* link to the validate script. 
The only secure way to access access the validate script is by 
opening a new browser window and going www.zoovy.com, logging in, and 
entering your username and password and then typing in the validation code.
