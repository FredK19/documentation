<h1>Order Import Tool</h1>
<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>

This tool allows you to import orders to your Enterprise database for processing.
The order import feature works along the same lines as the CSV product import tool. This
tool is designed to allow importing of
orders in sycnrhonization with the JIT Interface for Order Manager. Once orders
have been successfully imported, they will appear in the &quot;Recent&quot; tab in Order
Manager.<br>
<br>

The Order Import Tool is accessed from the 'Tools' menu on your Enterprise server as "Import Orders from CSV file."<br><br>

Follow this link for additional information on the <a href=../guide/jitprocessing.php>JIT Order Processing System</a> which can be
found in the Guides section of this manual.

<h2>Variables</h2>

These are the variables that constitute the column headings in the CSV file you are importing.<br><br>

%MKTORDERID - specifies the marketplace order id for the order.  This is typically the order id
associated with a marketplace like Amazon.com. This is a required field.<br><br>

%TITLE - title of the product on one line<br><br>

%SKU - UPC,ISBN, or internal SKU number<br><br>

%BILL_EMAIL - Email address of customer<br><br>

%BILL_FULLNAME - Full name of customer<br><br>

%BILL_ADDRESS1 -  Billing Address 1<br><br>

%BILL_ADDRESS2 - Billing Address  2<br><br>

%BILL_CITY - City<br><br>

%BILL_STATE - State<br><br>

%BILL_ZIP - Zip Code (US Only)<br><br>

%BILL_PHONE - Telephone<br><br>

For <b>International Orders</b>, you will need to upload a seperate file and include the following field names:<br><br>

%BILL_PROVINCE<br>
%BILL_COUNTRY<br>
%BILL_INT_ZIP<br><br>

We determine if an address is international if the BILL_INT_ZIP field is populated.

<h2>OPTIONS</h2>


Options appear at the top of a file, before header. Options always start with a pound sign.
The following is a list of options:
<br><br>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top">#CREATE_SINGLE_ITEM_ORDERS</td>
		<td valign="top">Tells the system to create an individual Zoovy order for each item listed in the order. Each line item in an imported order
		creates an individual Zoovy order.</td>

	</tr>

	<tr><td colspan="2"><aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>

Hint: If you are running behind processing orders, you can enable this feature ('CREATE_SINGLE_ITEM_ORDERS') to speed up order processing.
</div>
</aside>


<br>



	</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>#FLAG_PAID</td>
		<td>Flag invoices as paid</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>#CREATE_CUSTOMERS</td>
		<td>Creates an actual customer record</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>#JIT_CREATE</td>
		<td>Creates an entry in the JIT fulfillment table</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>#JIT_ORDERED</td>
		<td>Tells the system that this item has been ordered</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>#POSTDATE=YYYYMMDD</td>
		<td>Tells the system to post date the orders.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top">#TYPE=JIT_ORDERS</td>

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top">#TYPE=JIT_MANIFEST</td>

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top">#TYPE=JIT_INVENTORY</td>

<h2>%MKTORDERID - a required field</h2>

Please note: When using the Order Import Tool you MUST include the %MKTORDERID column. %MKTORDERID works using the same
principal as the %TRANSACTION column in a CSV upload for products with inventory. This is a unique number that can only be applied once.
This way if a file crashes in the middle of an import, or a browser session drops, or an employee accidentally loads a file twice -
the same orders will not be uploaded twice.<br>

</article>
<article>
<h2>Example</h2>

<pre>
#TYPE=JIT_ORDERS
#CREATE_SINGLE_ITEM_ORDERS
#JIT_CREATE
#JIT_ORDERED
#CREATE_CUSTOMERS
#FLAG_PAID
%MKTORDERID,%SKU,%BILL_EMAIL,%BILL_FULLNAME,%BILL_ADDRESS1,%BILL_ADDRESS2,%BILL_CITY,%BILL_STATE,%BILL_ZIP
ABCD1234,1294949398,johnd@yahoo.com,John Doe,191 Calle Magdalena,Suite 290,Encinitas,CA,92024
</pre>
NOTE: once this file is uploaded, any attempt to reupload the same file will result in failures for any orders that have
already been imported.  This avoids creating duplicate orders.

<h2>Dealing with Manifests</h2>


Suppliers often send Shipping Manifests, or Acknowledgement reports electronically -
the manifests contain a list of items which are being shipped along with dispositions for a particular batch.  The manifest reports are uploaded using the Order Import Tool on your server.
A #JIT_MANIFEST import really only needs to contain two columns:
<aside class="html">
<h6></h6>
<code>

#TYPE=JIT_MANIFEST
#MANIFEST_IGNORE_ERRORS
%SKU,%QTY,%BATCHNO

</code>
</aside>


The system will then change the disposition of the items from ON_ORDER to ACK_OKAY (meaning that we've received them in a manifest).
At that point you can use the JIT tools (JIT Expecting Report) to inspect the batch and determine which items are not going to be recieved so you can inform
those customers and cancel those orders BEFORE the actual items are received.<br><br>
From the "JIT Reports" area of your server, check the status of the batch in question. All items that remain with a status of "On Order" were not included
with the manifest and will not be shipping.  These orders would need to be moved in Order Manager from "Recent" to "Cancelled". These customers would then
need to be notified and refunded.<br><br>

<br>
<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>

If you do not specify %BATCHNO in the import file then you must specify BATCHNO when you are importing the file on the order import screen.  If you are importing a manifest with multiple batch
numbers, you must specify the %BATCHNO in the import file.

<h2>Dealing with Supplier Inventory</h2>


At this time Zoovy has limited supplier inventory support - this is mostly
for people who use Just in time ordering but who also want to report inventory
levels on their websites.
<br>

<aside class="html">
<h6></h6>
<code>

#TYPE=JIT_INVENTORY
%SUPPLIER,%SUPPLIER_SKU,%QTY,%MSRP,%COST

</code>
</aside>



<b>Column Headers:</b><Br>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>%SUPPLIER</td>
		<td>The supplier code</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>%SUPPLIER_SKU</td>
		<td>The suppliers SKU for the product</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>%MERCHANT_SKU</td>
		<td>Your SKU for the product (leave blank to use the same as the suppliers)
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>%QTY</td>
		<td>The instock quantity</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>%MSRP</td>
		<td>Retail Price - suggested by supplier/manufacturer (optional)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>%COST</td>
		<td>Unit Cost (optional)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>%FILTER=LT:#####</td>
		<td>If the column is less than the header value, then the data is imported</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>%FILTER=RE:/regex/</td>
		<td>Applies a regular expression to the column, if regular expression passes then the column is allowed to be imported.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<br>
<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>

If you do not specify %SUPPLIER in the import file then you must specify BATCHNO when you are importing the file on the order import screen (the BATCHNO should be your supplier code).
If you are importing a manifest with multiple batch
numbers, you must specify the %BATCHNO in the import file.

</div>
</aside>


<br>
<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>

Your supplier has multiple warehouses and requires you specify which order you want the inventory shipped from
then you should setup a separate supplier code for each warehouse.
