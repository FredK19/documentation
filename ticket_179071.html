Issue: EBAY(err 841) Requested user is suspende

<br>

Platform: na
Topic: other
This is a new error we've seen come in on four or five orders thus far - when we look up the eBay users, they're in ok standings on eBay - so what does this mean?  (2008-10-99109 example)  This is erroring shipping costs so again costing business and/or loss of revenue at our busiest time of year.  Thank you.  Katy</article>

Have you seen any email notices from ebay or is there anything in your My Message page for the ronmad account?

Not that I am aware of - most of the rest of our orders from eBay are coming through just fine - this is by no means all the eBay orders, just a small handful (maybe 30?) so I doubt it has something to do with our account across the board?  Thx, Katy

Ok, I don't know what else to do.  Melissa thought it might be something w/toynk's  account. (not happening to all orders, as noted below)   Toynk looked up the ebay users, when this occured & their standing with ebay were good.
