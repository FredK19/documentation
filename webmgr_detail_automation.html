Automated Behaviors lets you configure things like payment 
reminders which can be automatically sent to customers who have outstanding (unpaid) orders.

<h2>Payment Reminders</h2>


Whenever you receive payment for an item, you should make sure you convert that customers order or 
incomplete sale to a paid status. Payment reminders are sent when either an incomplete item has not been 
purchased (which is technically a checkout reminder), or when a customer has gone through checkout and 
selected a payment method which requires that you manually set the order to paid when the payment is 
received (e.g. Checks or Money Orders).
<br>
So there are really two types of payment reminders, one for orders and one for incomplete sales. 
<br>
To stop an automatic payment reminder for an incomplete sale you should login to the website, 
proceed to Orders and then Incomplete sales, and flag the external item for the customer as PAID.
<br>
To stop the payment reminder for an order you should go to the orders tab on the website, 
search for the specific order number and then manually change the payment status to paid.
Zoovy will continue to send payment reminders until the sale is recognized as paid. If you would 
like to disable automatic payment reminders (or change their frequency) then you should go to Setup and select Automated Behaviors.
