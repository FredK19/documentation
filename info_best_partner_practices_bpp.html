The Best Partner Practices (BPP) customer incentive program was introduced to clients on Feb 1st, 2007 and is only available to people on the Zoovy "ONE" Plan.

<h2>Best Partner Practices Overview</h2>

Zoovy has been in e-commerce for more than 7 years and we've seen a lot of successful businesses, we've also seen a lot of 'what-not-to-do'.  We view your website as a partnership between our technology &amp; services and your business ingenuity and determination. The intent of the Best Partner Practices (BPP) program is to maximize the long term probability of success for your business based on the following principles:

<br>
<ol>
<li> As business owner you want to know something is going to work before you commit to it. Sometimes getting those assurances is incredibly difficult and making sure those promises are delivered is even harder. By working together we can make it easy. 

<li> The Internet changes often and online businesses need to adapt quickly and predictably to avoid disruptive change. By working together we can make it predictable. 

<li> Your time is best spent running your business rather than talking to a technical support department trying to get something to work or figuring out why something stopped working. By working together we can get issues resolved quicker and easier, and hopefully in most cases avoid the issues outright.
</ol>

<h2>Customer Goals</h2>

<section>
<h3>An ounce of Prevention</h3>
At Zoovy our goal is to show you how to use our technology do the things you need to do all the time, and let us help you with the things you don't. By becoming involved in your planning we can help you avoid most of the hurdles you would normally encounter on your own which dramatically reduces support costs.   BPP members pro-actively consult with a Zoovy support technician prior to making any substantial changes in the operation of their account or workflow. Together we can discuss the ramifications and potential impact of those decisions and schedule implementation assistance if necessary, in order to avoid business disruption.

Examples of major business decisions include: launching new specialty websites, adding new promotions, implementing shipping rules.

Avoid enabling any clearly labeled experimental feature without first consulting with the Zoovy technical team.

<h3>Approved Software for the best results</h3>
Did you know that every piece of software you use can potentially expose your business and it's customers to malicious hackers or unwanted downtime? Zoovy extensively reviews 3rd party software companies before they are allowed to provide their software as part of the BPP program. We take additional steps to make sure that software will plug-n-play correctly and not cause problems down the road. In addition we require any approved 3rd party software vendor provide high level support contacts,  well-defined escalation policies, and documented security policies specifically for BPP members thereby ensuring that you get the most predictable and best possible service.  

<br>
BPP members only use website technologies from the Zoovy BPP approved 3rd party software/service provider list. Zoovy does not engage 3rd party software providers when our own software already implements a similar business function such as website design, shipping air bill printing, etc.  

<br>

Zoovy selects companies who we believe have the best “overall” fit for our target customer profile and then integrates and supports that vendor. As much as possible we try to avoid needlessly integrating new companies unless there is a clear business case or unique demand within our customer base.  In the event there is no acceptable software provider on the compatibility list, a BPP member can request that Zoovy review the vendor for consideration of inclusion in the approved list.

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
If you find a company/service that's not our list - we want to know about it, just make sure we have a chance to evaluate it for integration issues before you purchase it. 

</div>
</aside>


</section>

<section>
<h3>Great looking Websites</h3>
It's a well documented fact that better looking websites which maintain a cohesive design and navigation make more 

sales. During the design phase we work with you to develop a style exclusive to your website, combined with easy 

to use tools that make that style easy to maintain. Building a website with a style guide and the tools to 

maintain that style is key to maintainability.    
<br>
We ask that BPP Members allow Zoovy the opportunity to bid on any custom website design work, print work, or 

custom development API work before it is implemented.
The customer's arrival to the Zoovy platform includes a custom designed website and accompanying “style guide”. 
<br>
BPP members agree to abide by the style guide (for their website) when making any changes in order to maintain a professional and consistent appearance throughout - remember better looking web sites sell more 

products. 
<br>
BPP members agree to use WIKItext for all of their formatting needs and not use HTML in any product fields. Incorrectly formatted HTML can cause your entire web site to be unusable, it can also create significant problems when trying to syndicate your products to many of the large marketplaces. Using WIKItext helps ensure that your product information is highly compatible with the many places that your products will be seen and reduces the possibility of extensive downtime cause by bad HTML formatting.
<br>
More information on the use of WIKItext can be found at the <a class="linkdoc" href="#?doc=50590">Doc 50590</a>

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
Our staff can assist with converting your product descriptions and other pages to Wiki Text.

<section>
<h3>Exclusivity</h3>
Integration is hard and often inflexible. Multiple work-flows are confusing and prone to errors. It's easier to 

become an expert in a piece of software when all you need to use is that software. 
We ask that BPP members process and fulfill all sales for the web portion of their business, and all other mail order or telephone orders through Zoovy provided those sales represent less than 50% of their overall gross merchandise sales. 
BPP members agree to process all web based sales through the Zoovy platform for the business unit and operate no other websites, with an exemption given for pre-existing websites which are declared prior to enrolling in the program.
BPP members agree to operate only one Zoovy account per business unit. 
</section>

<section>
<h3>Regular Reviews</h3>
We want to know how we're doing, and even more importantly what we could do better. We want to help you to use everything you can so that you're maximizing your investment with us. Lets work together to maximize your business potential. Once per quarter Zoovy staff will make themselves available to meet with the person in charge of website operations, and any staff deemed necessary to help you:

<ol>
<li> Outline revenue targets and upcoming projects (if any) in the following quarter.
<li> Discuss new features added to the Zoovy platform and how they could benefit the your business.
<li> Provide a single list of requested enhancements to Zoovy prioritized by importance to your business. 
<li> Participate in short focus groups in order to help Zoovy improve our software and customer service.
<li> * Get a behind the scenes peek at what will be coming out in future releases and how those changes will benefit your business. 
</ol>

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
* Execution of a Non-disclosure agreement (NDA) will be necessary prior to discussion of our development road-map or upcoming announcements.

<h3>Good Processes</h3>
Well defined processes produce high quality, consistent outcomes and if a defect occurs in the process, it's easier to identify.  Bad businesses processes cost companies a small fortune in lost employee productivity. 
BPP members agree only to use Zoovy applications and software only for the uses clearly defined by Zoovy and it's technicians, staying within “Supported Configurations” which are documented in the Zoovy webdoc.    
</section>

<section>
<h3>A Professional Working Relationship</h3>
This is a complex platform, and you may find at times that things didn't work as you expected. We employ the most 

helpful, knowledgeable people in our industry who pride themselves on their ability to help our customers in the 

most effective way possible. While troubleshooting can sometimes be frustrating, we ask that BPP members, and 

their employees, work with all Zoovy staff in a reasonable and business-like manner to help address any issues as 

quickly and effectively as possible.

<h2>US Based Business</h2>
At this time BPP discounts are only available to US based businesses.

<h2>Our Promise to You</h2>

<section>
<h3> Discount from Zoovy</h3>
As a company we've found that BPP members not only cost less to support, but they also consistently generate more sales - your success also means our success! 
We pass those savings on to you by applying an across the board reduction to any success fees, monthly minimum fees, support fees, or design/development work. 

<br>
In addition for each $100 you spend with Zoovy we will add 1 hour of pre-paid time to your account to be used for support, to go over implementing any new features or changing existing business processes. 

<a class="linkdoc" href="#?doc=50551">Doc 50551</a>

</section>

<section>
<h3>3rd Party Software Discounts</h3>

When a 3rd party software provider gets approved into the BPP they not only have to meet certain technical requirements but also some support requirements. Once they've integrated with Zoovy then bringing on each new merchant actually costs them less (because the process is well documented and obstacles have been addressed.) We routinely ask providers to pass those savings to you in the form of BPP exclusive sign up bonuses.

</section>

<section>
<h3>Quick Question – No Problem</h3>

We provide a comprehensive online documentation system to all our customers. But sometimes a little clarification of the documentation is always helpful and can boost your confidence. We want to make sure you get the right information, so any phone call which takes less than 15 minutes to solve is free.
</section>

<section>
<h3>No surprises</h3>
Any issue that results from a recent system change or software upgrade by us is always diagnosed for free.
</section>

<section>
<h3>Quarterly Reviews for 2-way feedback</h3>
This is a partnership right? BPP members who participate in a quarterly review will receive upcoming detailed information of what is planned (sneek peeks) and tips on how to use the existing technology even better. 

<br>
Quartery reviews also provide the opportunity for BPP members to suggest new features for our next roadmap. Each feature request (up to 5 per quarter) will be given to the development team and analyzed and then a 'thumbs up' or 'thumbs down' will be provided along with an explanation of that decision.

<a class="linkdoc" href="#?doc=51016">Doc 51016</a>

</section>


<section>
<h3>Easy Custom Software Integration</h3>

Being able to suggest feature enhancements for the core platform is great - but as your business grows the likelihood that your business will require some type of niche software will expand as well. Here at Zoovy we refer to this type of development as "custom business logic".

<br>

We've gone to great lengths to provide a cornucopia of integration potential. Our commitment to BPP customers is as long as you've got a budget, we'll absolutely find a way to make whatever you need happen - no exceptions. You will not receive a "No" answer from us. 

<br>

Even better you'll find our scoping process to be highly efficient, and incredibly reasonable. Zoovy maintains tight working relationships with a variety of in-house, as well as on-shore and off-shore development partners. Our team of experienced developers can also perform project management (at your request) to ensure that your project comes in on time and on budget!

</section>


<section>
<h3>Enhanced Ticket Escalation</h3>
If you've got a real serious problem and you need to get something answered right away you can request an escalation of a support issue. 
<br>
BPP members receive Up to 3 escalations per month, that will move your ticket to the front of the line ahead of all other tickets (except any other escalated tickets).  This can be done via the client services team, or by contacting the customer service manager directly.
</section>

<section>
<h3>Staffing Services</h3>
We've built small highly competent technical teams over here, we have re-occuring job subscriptions with several major national online job websites. Over the years we have job descriptions and screening processes that generate highly qualified, friendly, hard-working applicants. Let us help you screen, interview and hire your next technical worker, then we'll train them and turn them back over to you so you can focus on running your business.  

<br>

We also have pre-trained off-site contractors for only $10/hr. available to help your company with a variety of tasks on either a project, or on-going basis. This can be handling customer service, managing eBay listings, mapping Amazon data, or other business process tasks. Need some extra staff for your busy season - we can help!
</section>

<section>
<h3>Professionalism</h3>
As a BPP participant if you ever feel we're not holding up our end of the bargain we want to know about it. Zoovy  provides BPP members direct access throughout the company all the way up to the CEO to address any situations you feel may not have been handled with the appropriate level of professionalism. 
</section>

</article>

<article>
<h2>Other Rules and Stuff</h2>

<section>
<h3>Feature Requests</h3>
Feature requests and requests for non-approved 3rd party integrations should be submitted and discussed at the quarterly business review. Preferably prioritized in terms of direct importance to the customer. Zoovy reserves the right to only address the top 5 feature requests per member per quarter. 
</section>

<section>
<h3>No shirt, no shoes, no service.</h3>
The BPP is like a secret clubhouse for successful businesses.
Zoovy reserves the exclusive right to deny admittance into this program to anybody, for any reason.  We recommend all participants provide a toll free support number or live chat  mechanism for their customers concerns/questions.
</section>

<section>
<h3>Dedicated point of contact</h3>
BPP clients will provide a sole dedicated point of contact who is responsible for discussing, approving, and coordinating configuration changes.   The dedicated contact will be responsible for training other staff throughout the company.  

</section>

<section>
<h3>Web Design</h3>
As part of the BPP we provide customers with a discount on our services, in return we expect those clients to maintain a professional website appearance with a layout which has an emphasis on converting sales, and be actively spending money on marketing to drive traffic to those sites. There is no requirement that clients purchase web design services from us, rather that they have a professionally designed and maintained website. 
<br>

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
During the website design process if a site owner requests modifications we feel are not in the best interest of sales we will communicate the "defect" to the site owner along with suggestions to correct it. At that point the site owner has three choices:

<ol>
<li> Allow us to correct the defect, typically at no charge. 
<li> Leave the defect in the design and drop out of the BPP program.
<li> Take the "double or nothing" challenge: we will design both sites and run an A/B test across a minimum of 500 orders.
</ol>

The A/B test sends 50% of the shoppers to design A, and 50% of the shoppers to design B. If the site with the defect identified by Zoovy generates the same or better sales, then the site owner is thanked for educating us, and will be refunded all design charges they've paid -- however if the Zoovy recommendation wins, then the site owner pays double the design fees.  We feel this is fair because this process puts the burden of proof on Zoovy to ensure that our recommendations will cause the site to out-perform the business owners.  In other words the Zoovy recommended site must outperform in both total sales percentage (conversions), and dollars of sales (revenue) in order to be considered the winner.

<h2>How to get into the program</h2>

<section>
<h3>Business Practice Review</h3>
Getting into the program is easy, just sit down with one of our friendly implementation experts to go over our business practice review that analyzes (and occasionally offers suggestions) about 7 core areas of your business and then maps our software to those business processes in the most efficient and well supported manner. 
</section>

</article>

<article>
<h2>How to opt-out of the program</h2>

<section>
<h3>Opting out</h3>
We can't imagine why you'd want to leave the BPP program, but Sometimes it happens. BPP participants may determine 

to simply utilize Zoovy as a technology provider rather than an advisory and partner. To opt out the business owner 

needs to send a support request as the Admin user and request removal from the program. Zoovy will then conduct a short follow up call with the billing contact to determine their motivation for leaving the program, and to make 

sure they understand the agreement, most importantly, to see if we can address the reason for leaving so at a 

minimum it does not potentially impact future BPP participants. Immediately following that meeting the business 

will be opted-out the program.    
</section> 

<section>
<h3>Notice of Breach/Cure</h3>
Sometimes business operators don't realize the rules of the BPP, and honestly they're more like guidelines anyway. 

If during the course of our operations Zoovy discovers a business is operating outside the mutually agreed upon guidelines we will send a notification, and follow up with a phone call. The notification will include specific steps to resolve the problem and a time frame no less than 30 days to fix it (we are always available to assist). Zoovy reserves the right to handle intentional and egregious, or repeated violations may result in a suspension or permanent ineligibility from the program. 
</section>

<section>
<h3>Project Cancellations</h3>

Zoovy endeavors to resolve any and all situations amicable with all clients, but especially with our BPP participants.  We provide flexible financing solutions, and offer extremely competitive rates to BPP members with the belief in good faith that maximizing the short term expenditures of a client will allow them to do more, and thereby provide a greater long-term profitability for both us and the client. 

<br>

Zoovy's BPP rates are substantially lower than anybody else in the industry for an equivalent level of service. For this reason any customer who attempts to perform a credit-card chargeback, or wire transfer reversal will immediately be terminated from the BPP program.
In addition the client shall be responsible for the full non-BPP discounted amount on any charges associated with a reversal/chargeback.
Furthermore any project termination by client within 6 months of completing a project, shall give Zoovy the right to recoup the BPP discount provided to the client. 

<br>

For the purpose of credit-card chargebacks, or wire reversals both parties agree that any design or development project; once started shall be considered "delivered and complete" as soon as the first preview on a design task, or first functional prototype of a development project is attached to the project ticket. Both parties further agree:
<ul>
<li> Once the first prototype is delivered, the client waives all rights to perform chargebanks or wire transfer reversals, and must either cooperate with Zoovy, or submit to binding arbitration in San Diego, CA. 
<li> Guidance with regard to partial credits will be provided according to the Zoovy cancellation policy located at http://support.zoovy.com/cancel (even if the account is not being terminated).
<li> Clients who perform chargebacks without giving Zoovy the opportunity to cure any defect with at least 15 days prior notice shall not be entitled to a refund under any circumstances.
<li> Furthermore if a project deadline, or specific functionality was not explicitly listed in an executed agreement it shall not be considered part of the project; regardless if Zoovy subsequently acknowledged, offered, or committed to do that portion of the project for or without cost in an attempt to keep the project moving forward.
</ul>

</section>


<section>
<h3>Re-entry</h3>
If a business opted out of the BPP and later realize it was a mistake then the business may re-join the program by 

conducting a new Business Practice Review. The discounts will not be reinstated for 60 days upon re-entry. In 

the event a business left the program in an unprofessional manner, Zoovy reserves the right to refuse re-entry.

<h2>Eligibility of Legacy Accounts</h2>

UPDATE: September 1st, 2007
<br>

The BPP was introduced with little fan-fare on February 1st, 2007 as an experimental opt-in pilot program for new clients specifically tailored to facilitate an easier migration to the Zoovy platform.  

<br>

We have been actively monitoring the effectiveness of the program with regard to support tickets, customer sales growth and overall customer satisfaction.  The BPP has far exceeded it's original expectations, and significantly helped us to identify how we can be involved in a consultative role in our customers businesses -- which directly helps us build a better, more stable and feature rich product for clients to operate on.  

<br>

Clients on revision 2.0 pricing (Prior to February 1st, 2007) should contact our sales department to learn about how to enroll in the program. 
For most accounts enrollment is FREE, and results in a negligible (+/- 10%) difference in monthly billing - all of which can be covered and will be explained on our standard pricing contract. In addition via the BPP we also offer negotiated discount rate plans for higher volume customers.
