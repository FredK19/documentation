[[SECTION]Concept Overview]

[[STAFF]]
Please do not edit this document. 
[[/STAFF]]

This package is no longer offered to clients. Zoovy offered a Zoovy "One" package to clients. In addition we encouraged our clients to enroll in our "Best Partner Practices" incentive program which offered a combination of competitive discounts, VIP service levels, and special services for clients who agree to stay within a specific "support profile".

[[BREAK]]

[[SUBSECTION]Monthly Minimum vs. Success Fee]
Zoovy charges either a monthly minimum, or a success fee (based on a % of sales) - whichever is greater. Our clients only pay one fee - never both.  That means that features and additional services can be added at anytime, at no additional cost provided the sales volume exceeds the monthly minimum.  Zoovy is a broad platform with many exciting features and we want clients to use as many as possible.

[[BREAK]]

[[HINT]]
Best Partner Practice (BPP) Discounts apply to both Success Fees, and Monthly Minimums. 
[[/HINT]]

[[SUBSECTION]Zoovy ONE Pricing]
The Zoovy One Pricing plan includes a monthly minimum fee of $132/mo. plus the fees for any feature bundles. The success fee is 2% before any BPP discounts. <br>
A fee of $25 per 2,500 SKU's or 1gb of disk space used (whichever is greater) beyond the 5,000 SKU's and 2gb of storage are included. 

Zoovy One accounts include as standard:
<li> 1 admin account and 3 user accounts each with their own mailbox.

[[BREAK]]

Zoovy ONE has a one time provisioning/setup Fee of $150 â€“ which includes zero hours of implementation, but covers the first 45 days of access.

[[SECTION]Best Partner Practices (BPP) Incentive Program]

The Best Partner Practices program was rolled out by Zoovy in 2007 as a way to align our internal business units much closer with our clients. Clients who participate in the Best Partner Practices (BPP) Program understand the value that the Zoovy platform delivers to their business and are committed to maximizing their revenue using our software. 

[[BREAK]]
A full description of the program can be found: 
[[LINKDOC]50849]


[[SUBSECTION]BPP Standard Program]
BPP Standard has simple compliance guidelines, and is available to all clients using "Zoovy ONE" who wish to participate.[[BREAK]]  
The BPP Standard Program:
<li>  Offers a 12.5% discount on all services purchased from Zoovy.
<li> Establishes a maximum $12.50 cap per order is applied (so clients never pay more than $12.50 in success fees).
<li> Gives 1 hour of implementation for every $100 spent with Zoovy in monthly minimums or success fees. 
<li> Requires annual "followup" meeting, which can be done quarterly at the clients request. 
[[/SUBSECTION]]

[[SUBSECTION]BPP Preferred Program]
The BPP Preferred tier is our VIP incentive program for clients.  In exchange it has strict compliance guidelines regarding support protocols, and requires that clients not only maintain certain revenue goals, but also integrate only Zoovy sanctioned 3rd parties to ensure the highest level of compatibility. <br>
The BPP Preferred Program:
<li> Offers a 25% discount on all services purchased from Zoovy.
<li> Does not have a maximum fee per order (unlike standard).
<li> Gives 1 hour of implement for every $100 spent with Zoovy in monthly minimums or success fees.
<li> Requires demonstrated marketing spend of $2,500/mo. in ad-words, eBay fees, or other 3rd through our marketing services group. 
<li> Requires $50,000 gross sales within the platform over the past 3 months, and a projected sales volume of at least $1m/annually. 
<li> Site's must meet specific aesthetic design requirements. 
<li> Requires annual review meeting, which can be done quarterly at the clients request.

[[SECTION]Design Charges]
[[SUBSECTION]All Zoovy Design projects are done hourly.] 
Estimates that are based on previous projects are provided. Zoovy will endeavor to inform clients prior to exceeding budgets. Design hours are pre-purchased. Unused hours remain in a bank which can be put towards future projects. [[/SUBSECTION]]

[[BREAK]]

[[HINT]]
Many customers (mistakenly) wait until their design is done before really focusing on their implementation. The Design and Implementation processes should run concurrently, otherwise the site will typically take 8-12 weeks to get online. 
[[/HINT]]

[[/SECTION]]


[[SECTION]Setup Fees &amp; Initial Grace Period]

Zoovy anticipates a normal implementation time frame of approximately 3-10 weeks depending on the complexity of each project. Since there is no "Go Live" button in the Zoovy interface and clients can start processing orders as soon as the account is provisioned - Zoovy provides roughly a 6 week (45 day) grace period for all new accounts before monthly billing begins.


[[BREAK]]

Zoovy does not offer the ability to suspend billing until the store starts making sales. 
Keep in mind even if the store isn't making sales Zoovy will provide support resources, backups, and of course software updates, not to mention we're still actively working on improving the platform. 

[[BREAK]]
[[/SECTION]]

[[SECTION]Technical Support &amp; Implementation]

Providing knowledgeable technical support is the most difficult and expensive task Zoovy must perform to earn and retain our clients.  We provide free "Bug" based technical support, which does not include setup/implementation "How do I?" help. Implementation is available via same-day or pre-schedule appointments. 
<ul>
<li> BPP clients are credited with 1 hour for every $100 they spend not including implementation and support charges. 
<li> Non-BPP clients are credited with the difference between any success fees and monthly minimum fees. 
</ul>
The credited time must be used within 60 days of getting billed, but the support system will decrease from the time  from the bank which is going to expire first. Once a client has been billed, they are credited with additional support time that will not be decreased from their initial 10 hours that were allocated during provisioning.

[[BREAK]]

Zoovy has policies similar to your Cable or Internet Service Provider - even if you don't get online every month we still need to provide the service. Our polices are intended to benefit for the clients who can get on the system with less complex configurations who can make quicker business decisions and get online sooner. We do not provide credits for unused services. 

[[HINT]]
Zoovy stores can start selling on marketplaces such as amazon, and buy.com almost immediately (as soon as the products are entered). Merchants can also sell via eBay or Overstock Auctions using one of the built-in templates before their designs are finished.
[[/HINT]]

[[/SECTION]]


[[SECTION]How Success Fees are Calculated]
Success Fees are based on the subtotal.  All accounts have a minimum order fee of $1.00 meaning that orders less than $1.00 are rounded up to a $1.00 subtotal and then the success fee percentage is applied to that.  All accounts have a maximum subtotal of $10,000.  (Although some negotiated plans, or BPP incentives may lower this amount.) 
[[BREAK]]
Orders with shipping less than $1.00 receive a 10% discount on the subtotal.
When shipping exceeds the subtotal then the shipping total is used.
[[BREAK]]
Orders which are considered "Point of Sale" (created via the desktop client) or imported from another e-commerce system receive a 50% reduction on the subtotal. Which is applied after the discounts/subtotal modifications listed above. 
[[/SECTION]]

[[SECTION]Other Fees+Rates &amp; Policies]

[[SUBSECTION]Other Expenses]

Zoovy provides a variety of services on a per hour basis. The scope, and fees of those services can be found: 
[[LINKDOC]50551]

[[/SUBSECTION]]


[[SUBSECTION]Special negotiated rates]

[[/SUBSECTION]]

[[SUBSECTION]Other Charges]
<li> Custom DNS or MX records are Billed at a rate of $25/mo - these are for clients who for whatever reason require custom DNS configurations to support their mail and/or custom blog/forum software.
<li> Zoovy merchants are charged for support time if our support or billing department are contacted by upset clients. 
[[HINT]]
By providing a live help (chat) or toll free phone number for customer service a business can avoid these charges. 
[[/HINT]]
<li> $150/hr fixing database corruption - min 1hr
<li> $150 fee per high priority emergency call or ticket. A warning is displayed, and the fee is refunded for any "valid" emergency. 

[[/SUBSECTION]]

[[/SECTION]]

[[SECTION]LEGACY Account differences/changes]

Zoovy maintains 1:1 feature parity with the current Zoovy pricing plan and feature offerings.  We also go to great lengths to avoid substantially altering existing customer pricing (monthly minimums) for the lifetime of the account, (except when maintaining two separate packages is no longer possible). For this reason in virtually all cases legacy plans and feature bundles are cheaper than current plans and reflect the lower amount. For a review of your bill please contact our client services group by emailing billing@zoovy.com.

[[HINT]]
For most LEGACY customers it is not advantageous to change to the new pricing plan because of the lack of an order cap ($5.00 max success fee on most LEGACY packages).
[[STAFF]]
REMINDER: There is no need for customers to change billing packages â€“ do not refer to the new plan as an "upgrade", there is a 1:1 feature parity with the LEGACY pricing plans.
[[/STAFF]]
[[/HINT]]

[[BREAK]]

With our pricing, existing prices and functionality remain intact until changed. 
All features installed are grandfathered in at the old price â€“ if a merchant removes a feature bundle and then re-adds it at a later date they will pay the new (higher) price.

[[BREAK]]

LEGACY plans which cancel their Zoovy service and/or are automatically canceled due to non-payment and return later will be put on a current pricing plan.
