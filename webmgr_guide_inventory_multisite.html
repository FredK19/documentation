<h1>HOWTO: Share Inventory across Multiple Zoovy Stores</h1>
<article>
<h2>Goal</h2>

This document is written for people who have control over two or more Zoovy sites 
which share product id's. 

It is possible to designate inventory in one site as the "Master" and the remaining 
sites as the subordinate. 
Inventory will only be updated on the master site. Purchases made on the subordinate sites can optionally be copied to the master site via order dispatch. <br>
<br>

Throughout this document the term "Master Site" will be used to reference the site that contains the inventory records. 
The term "Subordinate" refers to any site that queries inventory from a master site. 
<br>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

A site can only be a master or a subordinate; 
it is not possible to configure a site as both. 
Both master and subordinate sites must have the SITE INTEGRATOR feature enabled.
Using the instructions included a subordinate site can only subordinate to a single master site. 
(Having multiple master sites is possible, but requires custom programming and is beyond the scope of this document)

<h2>Master Site Configuration</h2>

Before proceeding you will need to decide if the site will allow public queries.
If you do not allow public queries, you will need to supply your Zoovy password to the subordinate sites. 
Zoovy recommends you use a public site, because it will result in faster inventory queries.

To configure the master site to allow public queries you must select the option "Disclose Inventory Quantity to Customers".
Configure the Developer Settings to Use Local Inventory Only. 
To configure the master site to require a password, select any inventory mode other than disclose quantity.

<h2>Subordinate Site Configuration</h2>


Go to Setup / Inventory.
Under "Developer Settings" configure the site to "Use Remote API Only".
Put in a the URL of the remote site in the following format:
<aside class="html">
<h6></h6>
<code>

http://webapi.zoovy.com/webapi/merchant/inventoryapi.cgi/USER=MASTERUSER

</code>
</aside>


Where MASTERUSER is the username of the master site.
If the Master site is not public then you must also specify the site password

<h6></h6>
<code>

http://webapi.zoovy.com/webapi/merchant/inventoryapi.cgi/USER=MASTERUSER/PASS=MASTERPASS

</code>
</aside>

<h2>Warning: Using Local + Remote Inventory</h2>

Please note: the "Use Local Store Inventory + Remote API" may produce undesired results when communicating between two Zoovy sites. 
This mode will use local product settings, then query the local store inventory, and then if no local inventory record is 
found (but inventory is enabled) the system will then query the remote site. 
This setting is primary intended for developers of supply chain 
management applications who are managing inventory directly from the webapi.
We expect to deprecate this approach in the near future, in favor of virtual products.
