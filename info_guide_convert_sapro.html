<h2>Importing Data</h2>


To migrate the Sellers Assistant Pro Database you simply add the Zoovy headers by exporting the data 
from MS-Access to Microsoft Excel, then converting to a CSV file and adding the appropriate columns in the 
SA Pro database. This can typically be done by Zoovy staff. <br>
<br>
One of the biggest issues importing the SA Pro database is images - there are a variety of ways to deal with this
but the easiest is to use Product Manager to do a mass import of all the images and then just treat the images as if
they already exist on Zoovy.

You can also simply request an import of your running eBay auctions.

This probably won't get all your data, but at least it will provide a starting point.
