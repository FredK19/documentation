I am getting this error now on  my refresh on the default profile. Can you tell me what this means?

<h2>Resolution</h2>
It means you don't have the autopilot feature enabled in eBay syndication.

The error is generated because you didn't implicitly configure an ebay title for your product and so the system won't "guess" and try and use the product name unless the auto-pilot feature is turned on.
