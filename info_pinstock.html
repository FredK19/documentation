<h1>Product Inventory Notifications for your Shoppers</h1>


<article>
<h2>Concept Overview</h2>
Allow your customers to opt-in to an email notification which will be sent when an item which was at 0 inventory is back in stock.

<h2>How do I enable this</h2>
Currently, a member of our staff is required to enable this feature. Simply submit a support ticket asking that the PINSTOCK feature be enabled and we'll take it from there.

<br>
Once the feature has been enabled, there is nothing you have to do.

<h2>How does it work?</h2>
When one of your products hits 0 availability, the 'OUTOFSTOCK' system message is displayed on the page.  That message contains the code which will allow the shopper to opt in to the notification.  All they need to do is click the link and enter their email address.
<br>
Later, when the inventory for that item is added to your store, an email is sent to the customer letting them know, typically within one day.  The email sent uses the PINSTOCK email, which you can customize through the email messages area (from site builder).

<h2>Inventory Settings</h2>
If you have your inventory settings set to 'remove items from website when inventory hits 0', then the impact of this feature is going to be minimized, because few people will be able to get to the product detail page.
<br>
Few?  Yes, even if you have your store set up to remove 0 inventory items, the product page does still exist, and any hardcoded links you have set up (such as banners) would still be active.  Customers who have bookmarked the page would also still be able to see it.

<h2>Support for PINSTOCK</h2>

Zoovy was happy to implement this feature for you at no additional cost to you.  However, if you go in to customize the verbage in the OUTOFSTOCK system message and break something, a member of our graphic design team will be required to troubleshoot it.  The time required to troubleshoot and fix will be billable with a one hour minimum.  Please use caution when editing the system message.

Avoid using single and double quotes anywhere in the system message.

If you feel that the text for the out of stock message gets lost and you would like to do something more custom, such as a graphic, it is possible.  Reopen the original support ticket you created or create a new one with a brief description. The time required to implement any upgrades would be billable (it requires a graphic designer).
