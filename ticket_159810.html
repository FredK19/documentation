<h2>Issue #159810: Checkout appearing insecure / crossed-out lock</h2>

I want to have a Secure order form, where do I go from here?

<br>

I need some sort of logos or something showing them that the page is secure when they are ready to checkout, it seems to NOT do that now.

<br>

well I just reviewed it again, I do have logo's etc. but at the bottom it shows a CROSSED-OUT lock, then I highlight that and it says something like "warning unauthorized content"

<h2>Resolution</h2>
This is because you failed to properly follow the instructions when implementing Google Analytics.

Referencing ANY non-secure javascript include tags will make your checkout insecure. We recommend having Zoovy Implementation assist with the integration of ANY 3rd party javascript.
