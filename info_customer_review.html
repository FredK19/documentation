<h2>Concept Overview</h2>

The importance of organic content on your website can not be overstated.  Not only is it great for search engines, but recent studies have shown that more and more online buyers are placing a higher emphasis on Product Reviews.  In Zoovy, there are several system product layouts that allow you to enable this feature.  Alternatively, this feature can also be added to custom product layouts.

<h2>On the Product Page</h2>
Zoovy has two versions of the reviews piece.  One is Ajax/Web 2.0 enabled and one uses a popup. Currently, the ajax enabled reviews is only available in conjunction with the evolution theme.  Any of the other themes can use the popup version.

<h2>Adding your own review</h2>
In the product editor, there is a section for 'reviews' where you can add a review.  
<br>
You'll notice that there are several more fields here than what is available on the website.  This is for forward compatibility.  As the popularity of the reviews features grow, we will enable support for the rest of these features.
