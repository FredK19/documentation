zoovy admin-ui documentation
============================

this repo hosts the documentation for the zoovy/anycommerce/commercerack admin-ui experience.
we welcome (and appreciate) contributions using the issues feature.

these docs are updated with each release of the framework/admin-ui, and will eventually be branched 
with each release (and independently searchable).
we do not intend to go back and fix issues in prior versions unless it is a major issue.
Here in our opinion is what qualifies as a 'major issue':

1. a mistake that will likely cause data loss, or significant unrecoverable data corruption.
2. incorrectly references a required file or misses a critical necessary (non-obvious) step.
3. is ruled by a court of law in a meaningful jurisdiction to be inaccurate, profane, or offensive.

if you would like to contribute to the documentation project on an ongoing basis we request authors
make a fork, and show us what you've got and why you deserve commit access.
please write something good/useful - if we pull your changes then we'll also 
bestow you with commit access to our master so in the future you can commit directly to the master.

please keep in mind the 'master' version here will often represent a forward (not released) of our
product.  watching the commits here is a great way to see what we're working on. :-)
