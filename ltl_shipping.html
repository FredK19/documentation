<h1>LTL Shipping</h1>

<h2>Concept Overview</h2>


At this time Zoovy does not offer an integration with any freight companies.  If you are interested in having a custom integration done with a freight company, please keep the following information in mind.  We are unable to integrate with any companies who use widgets to determine freight costs.  Widgets will not work with our shopping carts.
<br>
However, if you find a service that offers an API for us to work with, an integration may be possible.  API's are able to communicate necessary information back to the cart.  Please keep in mind that this would be done as an hourly project at our development rate of $150/hr.  
<br>
In the meantime if you need to ship items via freight, you can setup flat rate shipping for its compatibility with various marketplaces.  If you need help getting this setup, please schedule some time with implementation.
