<h2></h2>
We have two kinds of specialty sites we'd like to do.  One, sites aimed at
certain demographics, is right in line with what you've designed specialty
sites to do.   The other is a wholesale-only site, accessable only to
registered customers with a certain wholesale price level.  You don't appear to
have to ability to specify checkout/access settings per specialty site, or to
verify for a certain price schedule before allowing access though.

For both types of specialty sites, I've got some questions about how the
categories/navigation would work.  If I create a Wallet Chain specialty site,
and set our Wallet Chain category as its root, will visitors only be able to
see subcategories under that category?	What if I want to give our specialty
site a different navigation organization to match the preferences of the target
audience?  Some of the categories we may want to be identical in content to the
"main site" categories, other ones we may want to customize to some degree.  I
can think of a hack or two with hidden categories and such that might make this
work, but they're just that- hacks.  Categories are already a bear to maintain
with one site as it is, with no real ability to move, copy, or shortcut
(symbolic link) easily.  No, we have not tried Warehouse Manager, but last I
heard it was still a little rough around the edges.]

A - You do have the ability to specify a pricing schedule to a specialty site but
not to password protect a specialty site without custom work. The custom
solution allows you all the functionality that you are asking for.

As for your categories, you can build them as you wish. All categories can
appear to your customers or only the ones beneath that category.

If you need detailed assistance on how to set this up please schedule a
training session with one of our Zoovy technicians.
