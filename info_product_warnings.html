<h1>Toy Product Warnings - Flex Edit Field</h1>

<article>
<h2>Concept Overview</h2>





<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div> As of December 2008, the the Consumer Product Safety Commission is requiring warnings to be placed on webpage listings to denote safety warnings that appear on the packages of toys with cautionary statements. A field has been put in place
to address this requirement, and may be added as a part of the flex edit fields.
Set up an implementation appointment or open a support ticket to have the variable,
zoovy:prod_warning, added to your account.

<h3> How do I know if I need to use this field?</h3>
If you sell toys that have warnings on the box for choking hazards, you are required to display the same warning on the webpages that you are selling the products on. For more information, visit the <A HREF="http://www.cpsc.gov/about/cpsia/summaries/105brief.htm">Consumer Safety Commission's Labeling Requirement for Advertising Toys and Games</A>.

Once the field has been added to your account, you will see a box labeled "Custom Fields (Flex Edit)" that contains the header "Product Warning" with an empty box below. Enter one of the following valid values if applicable.
