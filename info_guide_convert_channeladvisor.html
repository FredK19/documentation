<h2>About this Document</h2>

This document is designed to assist customers who are planning to transition from Channel Advisor to Zoovy.com.
We hope to outline the differences between the two services, and provide customers with a clean transition plan.<br>

<h2>Data Importing</h2>


<aside class="hint">

<div>

To migrate from Channel Advisor you should simply request an import of your running eBay auctions.
Please read the details on importing listings from eBay.com
<a taget="_top" href="http://webdoc.zoovy.com/info/index.php?GOTO=guide/convert-ebay.php">Click Here</a>
This probably won't get all your data, but at least it will provide a starting point.

A screen scraper is a program that acts like a user with a web browser and goes through each page attempting to pull out relevant information.
The channel advisor site is extremely dynamic, and contains a lot of javascript which is difficult to screen-scrape around.
Each time channel advisor makes an update the screen scraper breaks and must be re-programmed to deal with the new site.
The re-programming typically takes a week or more and is very intensive in developer time.

Zoovys scraping program was last updated on March 1st, 2004.<br>
It is also very slow, it takes approximately 7 seconds per product (this is due to the horribly slow Channel Advisor Web interface).<br>
<br>
<b>The following caveats apply:</b><br>
The scraper imports all "ADs", or more specifically the scraper simply creates a CSV file for all ADs that can then be imported into Zoovy.
Because it is converted into a CSV, all newlines (Enters) must be stripped from the description - but this probably isn't a big deal since
the field contains HTML (All CR/LFs are replaced by a space).<br>
<br>
The CSV Import tool will automatically download/copy images both in the product description, as well as the others images and will substitute link tags
in the HTML for the equivalent images on Zoovy.<br>
<br>
At this time the following fields are imported:<br>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Zoovy Field</b></td>
		<td><b>Zoovy Name</b></td>
		<td><b>Channel Advisor</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>zoovy:prod_name</td>
		<td>Product Name</td>
		<td>Ad Title</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>zoovy:prod_desc</td>
		<td>Product Description</td>
		<td>Text #1</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>zoovy:prod_detail</td>
		<td>Product Detail Description</td>
		<td>Text #2</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>%IMGURL=zoovy:prod_image1</td>
		<td>Image 1 + Default Thumbnail URL</td>
		<td>Add Image 1</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>ebay:storecat</td>
		<td>eBay Stores Category</td>
		<td>eBay Storefront Category</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>ebay:category</td>
		<td>eBay Category</td>
		<td>Category</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>zoovy:ship_cost1</td>
		<td>Domestic Shipping Cost - 1st item</td>
		<td>First Item Shipping/Handling Cost </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>zoovy:ship_cost2</td>
		<td>Domestic Shipping Cost - additional item</td>
		<td>Additional Item Shipping/Handling Cost </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>zoovy:base_weight</td>
		<td>Product Weight</td>
		<td>Weight in Pounds</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>%IMGURL=zoovy:prod_image2</td>
		<td>Product Image 2</td>
		<td>Add Image 2</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>%IMGURL=zoovy:prod_image3</td>
		<td>Product Image 3</td>
		<td>Add Image 3</td>

If you have a specific piece of information you'd like to see added to this list please let us know and we'll see if we can help.
Be aware that any other fields will require additional custom programming, and could be very expensive - of course having us do it may be cheaper
than entering all the information by hand so it's at least worth getting a quote.

At this time we do not import Inventory, Invoices, Images (unless they are associated with an Ad), or anything else that was not
specifically mentioned above. In addition we don't guarantee the Scraper will be working when you need it - and if it's broken it could take
multiple weeks to fix, AND it may never get fixed. This is strictly a convenience that we try to provide to customers converting to Zoovy - please
give yourself ample time to convert. <br>
<br>
Due to its highly technical nature the scraper program can only be operated by a Technician.
We do this by request only - and only for live accounts (not trials).
There is a one-time $100 fee [in addition to your account setup fee] each time we import your data - we give you the CSV when we're done.
(Unless you plan on using Zoovy and Channel Advisor for a while you should only need to import your data once.)
If we cannot import the data specified above then we give you the $100 back and there is no charge.<br>
<br>
<i>In the event you choose not to use Zoovy the $100 fee + the sign up fee is non-refundable.
BUT you will be able to use the CSV data we've provided to move to any other service or tool you like.</i>

<h2>Getting Acclimated</h2>

A few helpful hints to get you started using Zoovy:<br>
<br>
<li> Zoovys interface is a bit more "raw" than channel advisor equivalent - we use icons for anything (vs channel advisor which seems to have an icon for everything).
(NOTE: We don't intend to knock Channel Advisor, they are a great tool for entry level sellers and their interface is designed as such.)

<li> Channel advisor creates "Auctions", Zoovy creates "Channels" which then create "Listings".
<li> You can import inventory items into Zoovy using a CSV just like you do at Channel Advisor, but you will need to purchase the CSV package if you plan to use this feature after 90 days.
<li> Channel Advisor has "Ads" and "Layouts", the closest Zoovy equivalent is "Products" and "HTML Wizards".
Inventory is a property of a product, and a product can only have one Ad associated with it (but multiple channels, we'll explain that in a second).
<li> Each time you create a channel a copy of your Ad is saved in it, there are a variety of different channels which can be used to suit a variety of launching styles.
Scheduled listings are done by creating a "Scheduled" Channel.
<li> Channel Advisor lets you "Repost" a listing, Zoovy simply has you create a new channel (the one-time relist fee credit on eBay is handled by a feature Zoovy calls the "Recycling bin" - but the relist item happens automatically).
<li> Channel Advisor lets you import open auctions on eBay, Zoovy only tracks items it's listed.
<li> The layout functionality in Channel Advisor is really remedial compared to a Zoovy HTML Wizard, so if you want to bring across your auction layout it certainly won't be a problem
- you can either do this yourself, or have our professional services department do it for you.
<li> Zoovy is much more "data focused" than Channel Advisor - meaning that we give you a lot more raw access to the data and we expect you to know
what you want to do.
<li> Zoovy does not support adding images by FTP. However you can batch import images using the Product Manager windows client.
<li> Zoovy doesn't support archiving products, but we do supporting archiving orders.
