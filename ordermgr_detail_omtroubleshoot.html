<h2>Zoovy Error Codes Overview</h2>
This document covers many of the error messages that you may see while using the Windows Order Manager Client.  The list is not all the possible errors, but most of the common issues are covered here.
</article>
<article>
<h2></h2>
The following error codes are application errors generated by order manager.
<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>NEVER modify an order online after you have synchronized that order with Zoovy Order Manager.
</div>
</aside>

<table>
<tr>
	<td colspan='2' bgcolor='CCCCCC'><b>INTERNAL ERRORS</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><b>#Z0999 Unreachable Error: [Message]</b><br>
Designates that the internal function that causes sync was called 
improperly by the developer.<br>
<br>
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><b>#Z1000 [Any Inet Failure -- message from WinAPI]</b><br>
Z1000 denotes a network failure returned to Order Manager by Windows.
Typically this means the Zoovy servers were unreachable/completely offline.
This is not an application error. Check the customers Internet connection - verify they can visit 
https://webapi.zoovy.com/ using Internet Explorer and that they do not receive any SSL errors.
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><b>#Z1100 Received Unknown Response Type: [Unknown Content Type]</b><br>
This means that the Zoovy servers are misconfigured and/or the client is not actually reaching
the Zoovy server (e.g. being intercepted by a proxy). For example if a client connects in through
a hotel network, and hasn't authorized their Internet account then any attempt to access a page will
typically result in the network rewriting the request to an internet error server. In this case
it could also result in a Z1000 -- although Z1100 is more common.
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><b>#Z1109 - Content-type response from Zoovy servers was blank!</b><br>
See #Z1100 - the only difference is that this denotes that nothing was received, this indicates
that HTTP or HTTPS requests are being answered by something other than a webserver. Useful for
developer diagnositics, but effectively the same issue as #Z1100.
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><b>#Z1200 - No data/body received from Zoovy WebAPI Servers</b><br>
This indicates that the proper Content-type of text/xml was received, but the body was blank.
This is probably due to some sort of proxy which is interecepting and/or rewriting the request.
Ask about active filtering firewalls, try connecting the computer directly to the Internet and
see if the problem re-occurs.
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><b>#Z1201 - No data received from Zoovy webservers.</b><br>
See #Z1200, this can be generated if a response of blank was returned (versus the case of
#Z1200 were null was returned)
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><b>#Z1202 - webapi returned invalid/corrupt XML</b><br>
This indicates the proper &gt;Response&lt; &gt;/Response&lt; tags did not appear. This probably means
there was a critical application failure on the Zoovy side of things.
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><b>#Z1300 - Non XML data in response body from WebAPI - Line: [##] Position: [##] [Error Message]</b><br>
This indicates that the XML returned by the Zoovy webapi was not well formed/structured. This
indicates a misconfiguration on the Zoovy servers but can also be caused by corruption in the
customer data -- especially if data was raw loaded from another source such as a CSV file. 
This may be correctable by looking at the error and determining which (if possible) data is corrupt
and using the Zoovy.com online web interface to edit/fix the corrupt data.
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><b>ERR: 1002 - Recipient email [invalid request] does not appear to be valid.
</b><br>
This refers to a message that cannot be sent.  The error will referance an ID (eg Message ID: 1234).  In Order Manager go to Tools >> Email Manager and find the email with the corresponding ID. You can either remove the message from the list, or correct any possible issues such as an invalid email address or sending information.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td colspan='2' bgcolor='CCCCCC'><b>API Errors (intentionally generated errors)</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><b>#Z2000 - API ERROR: [Message]</b><br>
This indicates that the Zoovy WebAPI generated an intentional error (versus all errors prior to this
are really due to bugs/filtering/errata). Review the error message for further instructions and hints 
on obtaining a resolution. 
An example of what will cause this is when a user doesn't have the correct flags to be using the API.
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td colspan='2' bgcolor='CCCCCC'><b>PayLoad Errors</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><b>#Z3000 - Successfully received response from webapi but payload appears corrupt - Line: [##] Position: [##] [Error Message]</b><br>
This indicates that the data was received from Zoovy in a well structured packaged but it probably
did not un-encode, decompress, or un-encrypt nicely. This check is done on the payload (the actual data
within the request was invalid/not usable).<br>
<br>
	</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td colspan='2' bgcolor='CCCCCC'><b>Future Time Error</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><b>#Z5000 - The orders in your Order Manager was set to a future time. This has been corrected in the Windows Order Manager Client, but please contact Zoovy Support and let them know you got this message. Server time: [##] ZOM time: [##]</b><br>
This indicates that the ZOM machine holding the database is set to a time that is ahead of the Zoovy server. The time codes in the message are in Unix timestamps, and you can use a conversion to get the standard time to see how different the two are. This usually isn't an issue unless the time difference is overly large (like hours, days, or weeks, etc...).  To correct the issue you should be able to set your database time back the needed amount to remove the warning.  If the dates are widely different, then contact support as noted to investigate.<br>

<h2>Endicia Dazzle v7.0 Errors</h2>
<section>
<h3>Envelope Package Type</h3>
When exporting an order to Endicia Dazzle, if the user selects "Envelope" in Order Manager, Endicia will select another package type. This error occurs because Endicia Dazzle has not enabled Envelope in the current release.
</section>
<section>
<h3>Multiple Orders</h3>
If the user selects more than one order in Order Manager to print in Endicia Dazzle, Dazzle will always print one less than the number of orders selected. To avoid this issue, print your Endicia Dazzle postage one at a time or reprint the missed order from the Endicia Dazzle postage log. Endicia has been notified regarding this issue.
</section>
</article>
<article>
<h2>Unexpected end of file has occurred</h2>
This problem usually stems from splitting an order during high volume/poor connection times, and the order manager can not obtain an new order number from the web for the new order. The order then gets saved without an order number. This causing the sync process to fail downstream.<br><br>

This error often looks like this:<br>
************** Exception Text **************<br>
System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException: Could not find a part of the path.<br>
   at System.IO.__Error.WinIOError(Int32 errorCode, String maybeFullPath)<br>
   at System.IO.__Error.WinIOError()<br>
   at System.IO.File.Move(String sourceFileName, String destFileName)<br>
   at OrderManager.shipping.ImportEndiciaXML(String& EndiciaFileName)<br>
   at OrderManager.frmMain.frmMain_FormClosed(Object sender,<br>
FormClosedEventArgs e)<br>
   at System.Windows.Forms.Form.OnFormClosed(FormClosedEventArgs e)<br>
   at System.Windows.Forms.Form.CheckCloseDialog(Boolean closingOnly)<br><br><br>


<br>
To avoid the issue, make sure that when you split an order, that the new order has an order number assigned to it.  If not, exit out without saving, and try to split again.
<br><br>
This can also be the result of a corrupted dazzle.xml file. <br><br>
To single out to problem file, please do the following:
<br>
<li> Close Order Manager
<li> Open "My Computer" in Explorer (in Tools >> Folder Options show Hidden and System folders) and navigate to C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\ApplicationData\Zoovy\tracking. (Prior to 8.052 this was stored at C:\program files\zoovy\desktop\tracking).
<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
<li>If you are running Vista, the file location may be at
c:\Users\(username)\AppData\Virtual Store\Local\Program Files\Zoovy\desktop\Tracking

</div>
</aside>

<li> You will see an "Errors" Folder containing one or more .XML files.  It is one of these files that is corrupt.  Please notice, the file name has a Zoovy order number within it.

<li> Back in the Tracking folder you should see an error text file. Delete this file (or move it into the Errors folder.  Now you should no longer see the error in ZOM.  You should still take the time to find out which XML file cause the error to be sure that it was shipped (and sure that none of these orders get double shipped by mistake).

<li> One by one or in small manageable batches of 3-5, drag each of the .XML files back into the tracking folder, jumping back into Order Manager and changing tabs in between each order or batch.

<li> If Order Manager doesn't have an issue, proceed to moving the next file.  Repeat this until you get the error you received before.  The file that you moved into tracking last should be the corrupt order.  You may need to manually create the label/order unless you can spot a visual issue that can be corrected.
<br>
There is a possibility of multiple corrupt orders. Even after correcting the first corruption, please continue until you have gone through all orders.
<br>
You will need to reprocess the orders that are associated with the corrupted .XML file.
<br>
If you have problems with this, or need us to help walk you through this, please feel free to call our support line.  We can also log in remote to perform the fix for you (billable).

<h2>Runtime Error during Synchronization</h2>

Delete all outgoing mail, sync again and see if the problem goes away.
If the problem disappears after deleting all outgoing mail then
review the Troubleshooting / SMTP Authentication and Troubleshooting / SMTP Error codes documentation.
</article>
<article>
<h2>Missing orders/incomplete items</h2>

The most common reason for either missing incomplete items or missing orders is that
order manager was prematurely terminated during the synch process. (e.g. right click - end task) -- 
this will cause corruption in nearly any application but especially in applications 
which are synchronizing data.<br>
<br>
If you do that it is possible for the data to get corrupt.
If you update the incomplete item or order (e.g. edit the email address) on the web 
it will synch down to order manager.<br>
<br>
You should always let order manager complete it's synchronization.
If order manager hangs and says "not responding" then give it a few minutes before terminating it.
If the problem persists please contact Zoovy technical support.


</article>
<article>
<h2>Report Script Compile Error</h2>
This error is due to the fact that order manager version 6.xxx was installed over an earlier version. To resolve this issue, close order manager a delete the reports directory. Next, uninstall order manager version 6.xxx and reinstall. 
<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>Click By Click steps to resolve the Report Script Compile Error: <br>
<li>1. close order manager
<li>2. go to mycomputer
<li>3. go to c drive / program files / zoovy / order manger
<li>4. delete the reports folder
<li>5. go to control panel
<li>6. go add / remove programs
<li>7. uninstall order manager
<li>8. reboot the computer
<li>9. reinstall the latest version of order manager.

</div>
</aside>

</article>
<article>
<h2>Runtime Error 3709</h2>

You have a crashed instance of Order Manager which is still running on your computer and has not released
it's resources, and therefore still has a lock on the database. <br><br>
To Fix: press CTRL - ALT - DELETE all at the same time which will bring up the task manager. From the
task manager find the Order Manager process, select it and press END task, wait a few seconds, and see if
it disappears. If it does not disappear then wash, rinse and repeat. In the event you cannot make it disappear it indicates some internal error in windows, reboot. If the problem persists then you may have corrupt system files, often caused the installation of a newer or older product by Microsoft or another company which utilizes a Microsoft Access database.

<article>
<h2>XML Parsing Error</h2>

XML Error messages appear when you have corrupt data, usually you will need to contact
support when this happens. You may also check your orders for company data with an ampersand & in the title.
</article>
<article>
<h2>Corrupt Invoice</h2>

Order manager will report an invoice is corrupt if it has no contents.
In many cases you can repair a corrupt invoice by going onto the website and selecting the order,
and saving the order using the website editor. You can also reset the order to incomplete status, then reprocess it from the web.  For step by step instructions on doing that, type keyword restoreclaim.  Corrupt invoices typically occur when two people have been synching or editing an invoice at the same time. <br><br>

In some cases Zoovy can recover previous copies of the invoice from a backup,
if you do not have a hard copy of the invoice you should contact Zoovy support and ask them to do a recovery.

<article>
<h2>Error Code 12014</h2>

This is a SMTP error being reported as a winsock error.
Review the SMTP troubleshooting guide.
</article>
<article>
<h2>Sending a System Info File</h2>

There are time when we may need to see system information in order to diagnose the problem.  To create this file,go to start / programs / accessories / system tools / system information and
EXPORT the system configuration to a text file (please don't save it as an MSI
since only microsoft can read those). <br>

Then please create a support ticket and attach the file so Zoovy can continue to troubleshoot.

<article>
<h2>SMTP Problems</h2>

If you are unable to send email, or get an SMTP connection error, please do the following:

<aside class="cbc">
<h6>'Fix SMTP'</h6>
<div>
<li>1. Run Order Manager
<li>2. Go to Admin -> Techincal Support -> Log Sent Email
<li>3. Sync with Order Manager
<li>4. Attach the SmtpDebug.txt to a support ticket. This file is typically located in

<h2>Endicia Dazzle Labels not printing</h2>

If you are getting a runtime error 76 when trying to print postage through Endicia, go to Tools -> Endicia Dazzle Setup and change the file path from C:\Program Files\Envelope Manager\DAZzle\Dazzle.exe to <br>
C:\Program Files\Envelope Manager\DAZzle\dazzle.exe <br>
then save.

<h2>Jet Engine 4.0</h2>

After installing the new Order Manager I get a message that it cannot find Jet4.0.  I run XP and tried to install jet40 4.0.6226 sp6 like zoovy says to do but it says it detects newer files and cannot update and I still get the message - The microsoft jet database engine can not find the input table or the query DBASEVERSION
To Fix: You must delete your database to fix this.
</article>
<article>
<h2>Run-time Error 429</h2>

This problem denotes a misconfiguration of registered dlls on your
computer -- it was not caused by Zoovy, it is that some of our files could not
be installed on this computer because it conflicts with other software which
improperly registered dlls before we got there.  If you install order manager
on a different computer this is very unlikely to happen again. <p>

We have found on some occasions this error can be caused by the wspell.ocx control by wintertree
software. Wspell.ocx is a spell checker component. More information on how to fix
the problem can be found at:<br>
http://www.wintertree-software.com/support/wspell/registrationfailure.html<p>

This is the functional equivalent of doing brain surgery on your computer - so
if you're not comfortable doing it you might want to grab your computer guy and
give him the link.

<h2>New User Not Able to Log In to ZOM</h2>
If you have entered a new user and they cannot sign into Order Manager there are a couple steps first.
<br>
<li>Check to make sure they have access in the Web UI. Setup » User Manager » Select user and check there access.
<li>If they're access level is set, open ZOM.
<li>Before signing in got to the Admin tab at the top left
<li>Click and choose Account security
<li>Enter the requested information
<li>Try logging in
<li>If that did  not work, call Zoovy Tech support for a logmein session.

<h2>Run-time Error 430</h2>

Setup hangs on the Data Access 2.7 part at the
end and then freezes. Error when running program... when attempting login
receive message; run-time error '430': Class does not support Automation or
does not support expected interface.
Running v4.04 OM on Win98SE.<br>

To Fix: MDAC 2.7 setup requires the updated windows installer
package, and there are 2 versions available, one for 95, 98 and ME, and one for
NT and 2000.  On machines where the Windows Installer update 2.0 is not
installed, the Zoovy OM 4.04 setup program will not work, as it will hang on
the MDAC 2.7 setup. SDK for the update is available <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate">here</a><br><br>

Info on the SDK is:  Windows Installer SDK
Microsoft? Windows? Installer is an installation and configuration service that
ships as part of the Windows .NET Server family, Windows XP, Windows 2000, and
Windows Millennium Edition, and is provided as an update to Windows NT? version
4.0, Windows 98 and Windows 95. It addresses the needs of corporate deployment
and provides a standard format for component management.

<h2>Error: Access is Denied</h2>
This error pops up when syncing. It is a scripting error in one of the ads shown while you sync (FedEx, etc). Simply hit Yes to continue syncing. It does not effect the product or data.
