<h1>Issue #159405: Need to merge two customer accounts into one</h1>

<article>
<h2>Issue</h2>
Issue: when changing customer email - received ERROR: The email address user@domain.com is already in use by customer #

Customer requested please change my username from my old email address:  user@olddomain.com to my current email address: user@newdomain.com


</code>
</aside>

When I used order manager to find customer by email, I did.  Then I pressed edit, but was unable to edit the customer email because the new email address already existed.  What do I do?
