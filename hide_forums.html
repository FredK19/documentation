<h2>Closing of the Zoovy Public Forums</h2>

<br>

On Thursday the 28th of September 2006 the Zoovy public forums were closed.<br><br>

We made this decision based on the fact that the forums were becoming an unreliable source of information for new and existing members of the Zoovy community.<br><br>

A minority of users were abusing the forums, posting code tips that could potentially break customer's stores, giving instruction on the use of Zoovy tools in non-accurate ways and posting information about Zoovy products that was inaccurate and defamatory. This situation was made worse by the lack of resources to police the forums for these types of behaviour and finally the discovery of a potential security exploit in the forum sofware. Based on all of these circumstances we decided not to continue the forum service. We do not have any plans to re-introduce the forums in the foreseeable future.
