<h2>Issue #160030: Why do I need to pay for Ebay bundle just to accept Paypal?</h2>


<br>

I no longer want the ebay bundle.  I tried to remove it but it removed my ability to accept Paypal.  Paypal is the most widely used payment method on the Internet and not just for ebay auctions. Why do I have to pay for an auction bundle, which I don't need just to accept Paypal?

<h2>Resolution</h2>

Paypal Express Checkout (not Paypal legacy) is included for free with all accounts - and that is what is included with most other e-commerce solutions these days. I would recommend you schedule some implementation time to convert your account to express checkout.<br>
Note:  Paypal legacy is the Zoovy term for original Paypal, which can be configured under the Paypal / IPN tab of the Payments section.

<br>

Supporting Paypal legacy and all of it's various ways of sending and receiving money requires significantly more technical support than a standard merchant account.  

<br>

We support a variety of advanced Paypal features that are specifically related to eBay and so we put it in the eBay bundle. Paypal IPN is really only useful to eBay sellers anyway.
