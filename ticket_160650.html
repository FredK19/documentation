Image was originally uploaded and the quality of image wasn't great. So you uploaded better quality images with the same name.
<li> You are still seeing the same image that you previously uploaded.

<h2>Resolution</h2>
There is nothing is wrong per-se. There are two things you can do to fix this.
<li> Rename the image so that you are uploading a completely new image that never existed on the server.
[[Hint]Our web servers will cache images for redundancy and speed. If you do not mind waiting for all of our cache servers to catch up you can leave this a lone for a few days and eventually the image will flip to the new image.<br>
<br>
<li> You may also hold down shift and click on the refresh button on your browser and this will tell the server to give me a new copy of this image.
