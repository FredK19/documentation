<h2>Overview</h2>

This document discusses the integration of non-ZoovyMail email services and custom DNS configurations with the Zoovy platform. 

<br>

Zoovy heavily discourages and DOES NOT SUPPORT configurations that are not operated by us. Furthermore even if a non-supported configuration is working, we will make no assurances or warranties that it will continue to work in the future. This is due to the number of issues surrounding the sending/receiving of emails such as getting them through firewalls, spam filters, relays, and the associated tasks of configuring custom A, CNAME, MX, and SPF records. 

<br>

Logic: The Zoovy system is "massive" in terms of functionality. Zoovy cannot provide our support staff with adequte training/skills to troubleshoot the myraid of issues that can arise in complex DNS and Email configuration issues, in addition to the functionality/features of the Zoovy system. By allowing more complex configurations we also dramatically increase the number of variables that must be considered in each problem.  We want our support staff to be able to focus their attention on supporting your business, rather than Internet protocols it relies upon. 

<br>

Regardless attempting to maintain staff which is an expert in "all areas of Internet protocol" would inevitably lead to a lack of focus on other complex functionality areas that are specific to the Zoovy platform (e.g. Shipping, or Promotions). 
By providing specific Internet protocol DNS/SMTP/POP3/IMAP configurations we are able to provide a more reliable, more predictable level of service.

<br>

While Zoovy does retain staff capable of maintaining and troubleshooting these "more complex" configurations, the additional complexity of this configuration inevitably leads to unnecessary escalation or worse: misdiagnosis of problems when they are first addressed by the level 1 and 2 tech support groups. Since our customers hold Zoovy accountable for wrong/delayed answers, we must make sure we are only being asked questions we can answer quickly, efficiently, and correctly each time. 

<br>

As such Zoovy has a very strict policy of not installing, supporting, facilitating, or troubleshooting any 3rd party email or complex "custom" dns configurations. Plus the ongoing support and regression testing to keep those services operating, while still continuing to introduce new functionality is simply unrealistic. As such we feel that it is necessary to limit the number of configurations we support in order to be able to make "predictable" changes to our platform.

<h2>Best Practices</h2>
In summary, too achieve the highest level of reliability and maintain a "supported configuration" you should:

<br>

1. register new domains, or transfer existing domains to Zoovy.
<br>
2. have your website and all pages served by Zoovy.
<br>
3. host the email for your domain with Zoovy.
<br>
4. if you use services like yahoo mail, gmail, aol, or others then either use a separate email client, or use the "Fused Accounts" service to automatically load email from those accounts into the ZoovyMail service. 
<br>
5. register separate domains through other registrars e.g. godaddy to host non-zoovy related pages or email services such as knowledgebases, or landing pages. 

<br>

If you follow those simple steps then things will work, and you will give us the tools to provide you with the highest levels of customer service. 
And in the slight chance things do go wrong you have our assurances they will be fixed in a timely, and professional matter since the issues you are having would affect the majority of our valued customers. We monitor the reliability of each technical piece of the architecture listed above to provide you with the best level of customer service.
