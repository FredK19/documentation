<h1>Authorize.net Secure Shopping Emblem/Seal</h1>

<article>
<h2>Concept Overview</h2>
This document covers the current policy regarding the Authorize.net Secure Shopping Emblem/Seal
</article>

<h2>Policy</h2>
At this time, there is no support for adding custom code to the sidebar, including the Authorizenet seal.<br>

You can accomplish buyer security and promote a safe buying experience for potential customers (the reason for adding the Authorize.net seal) by utilizing one of our current partners, BuySAFE.  Since most online shoppers don't know who/what Authorizenet is, having their seal is less likely to accomplish that task.  BuySAFE has established themselves in the auction community and has recently branched into the online store market.  Shoppers are more likely to be familiar with BuySAFE, which will promote a safe buying experience, especially with the degree of integration that we offer for bonding transactions.

<br>
Going forward, we have added authorizenet to the list that we will add to the list of available logos after the first of the year. 

<br>

At the time the logo sidebar feature was originally developed Authorize.Net did not have a logo program so they were not included. We have not gone back to update the list of logo/sidebar features since that time and so they have not been added to the list.

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
You can have it added by customizing your website theme and placing the javascript code directly above or below your sidebar. (This is something the Zoovy design dept. can assist with)

<h2>One Page Checkout & Seal</h2>
