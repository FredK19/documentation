<h2>The First Invoice</h2>

<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>
In billing we routinely get questions about the first invoice, people (mistakenly) believe it should come after their site is "Live". This is not the case. 

</div>

There is no "Go Live" button in the Zoovy software, in fact all stores can conduct sales on their very first day. Many customers are routinely processing orders after their first implementation appointment even if their design work is not completed.
Many marketplaces such as Amazon, eBay, etc. do not require that your design work be completed prior to conducting sales.

If Zoovy is doing development on a site or project it may be placed into a NOLIVE state where it cannot receive orders and monthly billing will not have begun.

A normal turn around time for us is 2-4 weeks, however each project varies by scope.  For this reason it is essential customers explicitly inform our staff that they require a "committed delivery date" if one is essential - regardless of how far off in the future that date may be. Our staff will develop contingencies in the event that unforeseen circumstances beyond our control delay a project (ex: bad data provided by customer), and be able to work backwards to ensure that the site is built, tested and ready to accept traffic on the committed date.

With many packages - during each billing cycle additional support time is added, and counters are "reset", and that additional time is decremented when an account uses implementation time.  Regardless if the account is actively selling, Zoovy is still enhancing the product and the client is still receiving free updates.  Zoovy still has to train and pay tech support people to wait around in case a customer feels like calling.  In several cases Zoovy also pays 3rd parties on a per client for every provisioned account - so again even if a client isn't using the service it's "live" and we're still paying for the account.
