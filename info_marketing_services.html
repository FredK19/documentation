<h1>Zoovy Marketing Services: Cookbook</h1>

<article>
<h2>Concept Overview</h2>


This document provides an overview of the list of tasks/job codes commonly used by marketing services, along with guidance about the scope of services and suggestions for properly estimating the hours on each type of job.


<br>

Recipes in this cookbook are broken into three categories: Basic, Standard, Advanced - reflecting the difficulty, and cost involved. In general every basic task should be performed before tackling standard tasks, and all applicable standard tasks should be done before beginning on advanced tasks. 

</article>


<article>
<h2>Terminology</h2>
The following codes are used throughout this document to reference for estimating. 

SMALL-SITE: Small site - less than 10 products.
<br>
AVERAGE-SITE: Average Site - less than 12 top level categories, less than 1,000 sku's, less than 50 categories overall. 
<br>
BIG-SITE: Big Site - anything bigger than an average site, quote varies significantly based on site size and "variances" throughout the site.  
<br>
INITIAL-SETUP: the initial time "sunk cost" involved in researching and establishing the foundation for a marketing task. 
<br>
WEEKLY-TUNING: the hours per week needed for ongoing maintenance and optimization. 
Actual services may be performed bi-weekly, or even tri-weekly as necessary, however the estimates are assumed to be every week.  For example: 3 hours every two weeks, would be written as 1.5 hours every week. 
<br>
MONTHLY-TUNING: the hours per month needed for ongoing maintenance and optimization. 
<br>
QUARTERLY-REVIEW: the time that should be budgeted for an end of quarter report that is recommended to determine the effectiveness of the campaign and discuss ongoing options.  Usually this will involve preparing a report and the time involved in presenting that report to the client. This is optional step, but is highly recommended. 
<br>
TEAR-DOWN: removing creative assets from site after they have been deployed. tear downs are commonly associated with removing seasonal/holiday graphics for example.

<h3>Radio</h3>
Establishment of tracking domains, suggestions on applicable media buys based on customer demographics.

<h3>Television Commercials/Infomercials</h3>
Consult with client on the production of commercials, advertorials, or even full length infomercials. Tracking of traffic on a site to determine site conversion effectiveness.  Television advertising and infomercials both involve an initial creative development cost, and then a series of ongoing media buys.  Television also lends a certain degree of credibility to a product or company.  This approach can work especially well for companies which have a physical retail counter in their local area as a way to solicit new customers.

<h3>Print Advertising</h3>
Consult with clients on the applicability of reaching targeted markets via. Similar to radio and television print offers a cost effective way to target niche segments of buyers who may be hard to find online.
