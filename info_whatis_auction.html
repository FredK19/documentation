<h1>Auction Bundle Overview</h1>

<h2>Auction Bundle</h2>






The Auction Bundle gives sellers advanced tools for creating, maintaining and improving their listings on EBay and OverStock Auctions.<br>
<section>
<h3>Powerlister</h3>
Powerlister is a tool for automatically re-listing your auctions not by time intervals but by situation. You can designate a combination of conditions that will reflect the manner in which you list your auctions. This is a popular feature for merchants who want to ensure that they always have a certain set of products up on eBay regardless of when the listing ends.

<h3>Batch Channel Launcher</h3>
The Batch Channel Launcher allows you to select a group of products and launch them all at once. It is the tool of choice for merchants who want several hundreds, even thousands, of simultaneous listings on eBay. The Batch Channel Launcher may be used in combination with the Powerlister or Scheduler to repeat those hundreds (or thousands) of listings indefinitely.

<h3>EBay Stores Syndication</h3>

<h3>Automatic Feedback</h3>

<h3>Zoovy Gallery</h3>

<h3>Use eBay Shipping Rates in Zoovy Checkout</h3>
The way eBay calculates UPS and USPS rates is different than how Zoovy does. eBay uses a simulation of UPS or USPS rates while Zoovy gets rates directly from the shipper themselves. As a result, if you use eBay's shipping calculators in your auctions you could carry over an inconsistent rate to your customer when they checkout through Zoovy. However, "Use eBay Shipping Rates in Zoovy Checkout" allows you to override Zoovy's shipping calculation in order to give your eBay customer a consistent quote no matter how they checkout.

<h2>Is the Auction Bundle right for you?</h2>
You can take advantage of eBay without the Auction Bundle. You will get access to our professionally designed HTML templates and unique profiling system for launching to eBay. However, if a large part of your business is driven by eBay sales you will probably want to add the Auction Bundle.
