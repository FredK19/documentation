<h1>Specialty Site Configuration</h1>




<article>
<h2>Concept Overview</h2>
Specialty Sites are a way for a merchant to have multiple online web stores that use the same checkout, shipping, payment methods, order processing, etc., as the primary store.  The configuration is fairly simple, but there are a few steps that you will have to take before you can start populating your site.

<h3>Setup Categories</h3>
You will want a different set of navigation categories for your new site.  This is done by creating a hidden category to represent your new site.  Then create subcategories beneath that one to be the navigation that is displayed.

<h6>Category creation steps</h6>
<div>
<li> Click Setup
<li> Click Categories & Lists
<li> Click Add New (beneath Homepage)
<li> Click Create a name for the category, and use an exclamation point as the first character.  That will ensure that the category is hidden and does not show up on your primary store.
<li> Click Save
<li> Expand the new category and click Add New to begin creating your subcategories.
