<h1>eBay: Automatic Second Chance Offers</h1>
<article>
<h2>Auto-Second Chance Offers</h2>



A second chance offer is a feature for a Chinese eBay listing that lets you offer the same item to the losing bidders.
According to eBay rules the second chance offer is not compatible with Dutch Listings, Fixed Price, Stores,
Buy It Now (when the Buy It Now feature is used), or eBay Motors.
Zoovy's Auto-Second Chance feature lets you automatically send second chance offers good for 7 days to 
the losing bidder(s), provided that you have inventory available, 
AND that the maximum bid for an item is above the price you have set as the Minimum Auto-Second Chance offer.<br>
