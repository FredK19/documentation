<h1>Channel Scheduler</h1>
<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>

Channels can be scheduled to launch one time, or many times. 
Channels which are scheduled to launch once will appear as status HOLD, 
whereas channels which are scheduled to repeat over again will appear as SCHEDULED in your channel manager. 
Please note scheduled channels never actually launch 
themselves, instead they create copies of themselves with new channel numbers that can be managed separately.<br>
<br>
The Channel scheduler can be accessed by going to Setup / Products, selecting a product then
clicking on Create Channel, and finally in the channel selection screen clicking the "Schedule" button.

<h2>Key Features</h2>
<section>
<h3>Remove from Website</h3>

Remove from Website will delete the product from all navigation categories before launching the channel, 
this is an ideal solution for one of a kind sellers who would like to place one-of-a-kind items on their storefront 
for up to 45 days before launching them to an auction venue such as eBay.

<h3>Respect Inventory</h3>

Respect Inventory will check for an in-stock quantity above zero before launching. 
In the near future this will also support safety inventory (specifically, after the new 
inventory system is rolled out in a few weeks).

<section>
<h3>One-Time Channels</h3>

One-Time Channels will appear with a status of HOLD until they have been 
launched (as long as they are not repeating). 
</article>
<section>
<h3>Include in Gallery</h3>

If you check this box then the item will appear in the pre-launch gallery.
The pre-launch gallery can be embedded into a product layout and used to display upcoming auctions.
</article>
<section>
<h3>Repeating Channels</h3>

Repeating Channels will appear with a status of SCHEDULER, and simply create copies of 
themselves with new channels that are Pending. The original Scheduled Channel status will 
say how many channels it has launched, and how many remain.
</article>
<section>
<h3>Maximum Launches</h3>

Maximum Launches tracks the number of times you want the channel to replicate itself, 
after the number has been reached, the original channel will move to Completed. 
Setting this to -1 will cause the channel to continue to launch until it is revoked, removed, etc.

<h2>Cancelling Future Launches</h2>

When more than one launch of an item is request the channel scheduler it makes a copy of a channel for each launch. 
The original channel is called the Parent channel, the copy is called the Child. Revoking the child will not affect the
parent, in fact nothing that happens to the child will affect the parent. If you want to stop future launches you must
revoke the parent channel. To find the parent of a child channel, go to the Channel Manager and view the details of the
channel - one of the properties will be the Parent.

<h2>Using Schedule with one of a kind inventory</h2>


There is a known issue with one of a kind inventory and channel scheduler.  
Scheduler is designed to launch listings at a set interval - for example every Sunday at 5:00pm. 
The problem is that with a one of a kind item, running on a 7 day listing you will not know that 
the item has sold until the next Sunday at 5:01pm. As such, Scheduler does not guess that an 
item has been sold, it either errors out the channel (due to lack of inventory - because 1 was 
already reserved in the listing which had not closed) or sell another one (because it was not 
configured to respect inventory). The work around is simpler than you might think - just set 
the launch interval to be less than the auction duration. For example if you want to re-launch 
every 7 days, then run 5-day auctions. If you want to run 7-day listings, then launch every two 
weeks as opposed to every week. This will give the system the opportunity to catch up, and make 
sure that an item has not been sold prior to launching another one.<br>
<br>
If you sell one of kind items exclusively on eBay, and you aren't overly concerned with precise 
launch times then you might also want to take a look at the eBay PowerLister for it's ability to 
specify allowed launch days and times.<br>
