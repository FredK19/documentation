<h2>Concept Overview: AJAX Compatibility</h2>

There is always a lot of misinformation regarding new technology.
Often times people are speaking authoritatively  about subjects they don't really understand, or worse you've got a person who understands it speaking to an audience which lacks the requisite level of background to really understand the issues.  I'll attempt to clarify:

<h2>What is AJAX</h2>
AJAX is a acronym which describes an entire suite of technology, that are available via well over 250 different programming frameworks, each having it's own code patterns, etc. -
so right off the bat that doesn't make AJAX search engine friendly, OR un-friendly - because it's all about the implementation of those technologies.

<h2>Why do people say AJAX isn't SEO friendly</h2>
Because AJAX requires Javascript, or Flash  (or both in some cases) to implement it's functionality - and search engines have a hard time with javascript and flash, people "jump to the conclusion" that compatibility is an either or thing.

I have to admit, before I really understood AJAX I believed the same thing. But at Zoovy we've done a lot with AJAX now and I realize it's a balance -- meaning that you can't always do ALL the cool stuff you want, but you can usually do most of it -- you just need to take into account how the search engines (google) will read it. You need to make sure you have site-maps (we do) and the ability to use the site and get to the data without javascript --- this is MUCH more difficult because anytime you add constraints it always makes a problem harder.. (not impossible, just harder)

<h2>How committed to SEO are you anyway?</h2>

So it's harder to make things search engine friendly, and I'll also point out that sometimes in a business it doesn't make sense to - especially when those SEO voodoo tricks compromise your message and hurt your customer experience.

<br>

If your goal is to get to the very top of the search engine rankings for every possible search, then I'd agree you probably don't want AJAX.  But of course you're talking about building a site that doesn't necessarily offer a good customer experience either, and who's revenue is going to be move up and down not through your controllable business aspects like pricing, design, availability and customer service - rather it will be completely subject to the whim of the Google SERPs. Personally I feel this is a little like strapping yourself into a lawn chair, with a bunch of weather ballons, a picnic basket and bb-gun and seeing where the wind takes you -- you can't really build a long term company based exclusively on your position in SERP results.

A business plan based exclusively on SERP's is not a good business plan.   If you have no idea what I'm talking about -- there is an interesting tutorial titled "what if Google designed for Google" -- http://www.meangene.com/google/design_for_google.html

<h2>Zoovy's approach to AJAX and SEO</h2>
<ul>
<li> Zoovy website designers won't build something that isn't SEO friendly unless you specifically tell them to (in which case you may not be a fit for BPP) - our peer review process ensures that.
<li> Our AJAX implementation was designed for e-commerce, we've designed it to be search engine friendly. AJAX should "amend a site" not be the site.
<li> Some reporting engines (Google Analytics for one) aren't fully compatible yet.
<li> Zoovy supports both SiteMap and GoogleBase Feeds.
<li> All Content is directly accessible via a URL (which is provided in the sitemap)
<li> Sure it's more difficult, and more expensive to build - but it works, and doesn't have the limitations of other cheaper solutions that cut corners.
</ul>
