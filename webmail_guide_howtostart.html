<h2>Step 2: Add Additional Users</h2>

<h2>Step 3: Add Domains</h2>


<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>

If you already have your domain name pointing at the Zoovy nameservers then you must complete this step and 
the next step by 6:15am PST, 12:15pm PST, 6:15pm PST, or 12:15am PST. Any changes you make to your domain names
will become active and if you have not finished setting up any aliases then you could lose mail.

<aside class="cbc">
<h6>'Adding Domains'</h6>
<div>
<li> Login to www.zoovy.com
<li> Go to Setup | Domain Hosting
<li> Click the "Add/New" button

<h2>Step 4: Setup Shared Folders, Mail Aliases, and Forwarding Rules</h2>


The ZoovyMail platform has the ability to provide "Shared Folders" which can be seen by multiple users.
We recommend setting up aliases, along with mail rules such as "orders", "support", "info", "questions", 
"ebay", "amazon", etc.  to be routed into a Folder in your "admin@USERNAME.zoovy.com" account. 

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>

This makes it easy to add/remove access to folders without the need to change passwords 
or manage separate accounts for each alias. 
This configuration is also the most compatible with upcoming Zoovy features which will make 
your employees more productive.

<aside class="cbc">
<h6>'Setting up a Folder'</h6>

<li> Click on "Settings" in the upper toolbar (note: you may be on this screen by default when you login)
<li> Click on "Folder Management" in the left hand menu
<li> Type in the Folder name (e.g. "info", "support", "questions", "orders")
<li> Folder type should be "Mail Items"
<li> Select "Root Directory" from the list of folders below.
<li> Click the "Add Folder" button to save.<br>
<i>Note: folders may take a few moments to appear in the list, don't worry - this is normal.</i>

<h2>Step 5: Point your nameservers at Zoovy</h2>


<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>

Before proceeding with this step, be sure to verify that Zoovy's nameservers have loaded your changes.
In Setup | Domain Hosting your domain name will say "Active" instead of "Pending"

</div>
</aside>



When you are ready to start receiving mail then login to the company you purchased the 
domain name from and change your nameservers to:<br>
<li> primary: ns.zoovy.com
<li> secondary: ns2.zoovy.com
<br>

<h2>Step 6: Setting up Mail clients</h2>


You can use virtually any popular email software (such as Outlook, Outlook Express, or Mozilla Thunderbird) 
to read and send your email. The steps for setting up each mail client are located at http://webdoc.zoovy.com/webmail

<h2>Step 7: Setup Newsletter Aliases</h2>


The Zoovy Newsletter feature in Zoovy will automatically handle bounced messages and unsubscribe requests.
Before you can send a newsletter you will need to configure one or more newsletter sender addresses. 
<aside class="cbc">
<h6>'Configure Newsletter Sender Address'</h6>
<div>
<li> Login to www.zoovy.com
<li> Go to Setup | Domain Hosting
<li> In the "Sender/From" address enter "newsletter"
<li> In the "Forward Responses To", if you leave this blank then email responses to your newsletter will NOT
be forwarded, if you set this then the Zoovy system will attempt to sort through bounces, and unsubscribe requests
and only forward you the relevant emails.
<li> If you configure an autoresponse text then that message will be sent. Some people prefer to respond with a 
short and simple message such as "To contact us please email questions@domain.com"
