<h1>Option Groups</h1>
<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>




An option is simply a list of choices that the customer must make before they are able to purchase the product. 

<br>


Option groups are setup and maintained from [Options] link inside the online product editor or from the option groups 
tab in Product Manager. Store Wide options (discussed later) are created by clicking the "Store Wide Options" link
in the online product editor.

<h2>Presentation of Options</h2>


The way the choices (options) are presented to the customer is selectable, you can use select lists (drop down boxes), 
radio buttons, checkboxes, or simply provide the customer with a text entry field. You can also associate 
images with each choice to make it easier for the customer to feel confident they are choosing the correct 
option.

<h2>Option Groups vs. Options</h2>


An "Option Group" is a term used to refer to a set of choices (e.g. "Size" is the option group, 
while "Small, Medium, and Large" are the options in that group. Each option group may have a 
maximum of 1296 options. Each option has a modifier that may affect the price and/or weight 
of the item by either a fixed number (e.g. +$3.00) or a percentage  (+%10). When configuring 
an option it is important you always be sure to have the + or . in front of the modifier. 
If you say .$3.00. instead of .+$3.00. the system will interpret that as a mandate to SET 
the price to .3.00. instead of adding $3.00 to whatever the base price of the item is.

It is critical you understand the difference between an option, and an option group 
before proceeding or you may get confused by the remainder of this document.

<h2>Inventory and Options</h2>


Besides the presentation, each option group has two important properties that must be set 
correctly when the option group is created they are: Inventoriable/Non-Inventoriable, and 
Product Specific or Store Wide.  An Inventoriable option group affects inventory, meaning 
inventory is tracked separately for each option in the group. Each option (or combination 
of inventoriable options) may have a unique in stock quantity, reserve quantity, and location.  
A non-inventoriable option does not affect inventory. You may have a maximum of three 
distinct inventoriable option groups associated with a single product. However  you can 
have nearly unlimited (1332) non-inventoriable option groups associated with a single product. 
You want to use an inventoriable option whenever the option physically affects the product, 
for example two different size shirts are physically unique, 
in this example you simply can't change a small into an extra large by adding more fabric to it.

<br>


Whereas a non-inventoriable option is more appropriate for things which can be added after the sale.
Examples of non-inventoriable options might include the type of handle for a golf club, or the 
optional bundled upgrades such as golf balls with a golf bag. 

<aside class="caution">

WARNING: You can only set the inventoriable property when the option group is being created.
If you do not set the inventoriable setting correctly, you will need to delete the option group and re-create it.

<h2>Product Specific vs. Store Wide</h2>


The other choice which must be configured when you setup an option group is the system wide or product specific setting. 
As the name indicates a system wide group can be shared across multiple products, whereas a product specific group 
must be configured for each product. Even though an option group is system wide, you may still select which 
specific options you want to include for a specific product. For example if you sell shirts, then you would 
want to configure "Size" as a system wide group and add all possible sizes. even though you may only stock 
Large and Extra large of some particular styles. Whereas if you sell automotive parts, and you have a single 
shirt with your company logo then it's probably more appropriate to create that as a product specific group 
since it's likely you won't be reusing that option group on other products. 

<br>


You may have up to 36 product specific option groups associated with an individual product, 
and you may have up to 1296 store wide option groups associated with the same product.  
Even though you can have 1332 option groups on a single product - it's worth mentioning 
that requesting a customer make more than 30 choices on a single product will likely hurt sales.
This applies even if you selling incredibly complicated products such as build to order computers.

<aside class="hint">

<div>

Zoovy staff internally refers to Product specific option groups as "POGs" and Store Option Groups as "SOGs" - if you're 
dealing with a developers, or high level technicians don't be surprised if they use this abbreviated notation.

<h2>Options and eBay</h2>

When launching an auction you must select which specific inventoriable option you want to use. 
If you do not do this, then your reserve inventory will not be tracked correctly. 

<br>


In addition once you have launched auctions attempting to change the inventoriable option groups 
will result in some potentially serious inventory side-effects, such as overselling, or underselling. 
Do not change your inventoriable options if you have active listings on any marketplace. 
If you plan to change the inventoriable options regularly, make sure to exclude the 
product from launching to any marketplace. When a product is launched to a marketplace, 
the reserve inventory will be selected for the specific inventoriable option you chose. 
The customer will NOT have the option to change the specific inventoriable option at 
checkout (customers using eBay checkout will not have the option to select any options).

<br>


The customer will be prompted to select non-inventoriable options during checkout.
eBay has a rule about choice listings: you may not sell listing with choices, it is against eBay rules. 
However what Zoovy does is not technically in violation of that rule, because with Zoovy you should be 
advertising a specific distinct inventoriable product. If a customer contacts you after the listing is 
over and asks for another size and you give it to them . then there is nothing against eBay rules 
with that provided you don't change the closing price (in fact we'd argue that it is contrary to the 
very principles eBay's community is built upon.) As long as you don't mention the customer will have 
the ability to choose a size after the listing is over, you shouldn't run afoul of eBays safeharbor dept.

It is important to realize the following things: It is against eBay rules to change the price of an item 
after the sale, so offering eBay users the ability to upgrade/downgrade specific choices is against 
eBay rules. Zoovy will let you do this, but you shouldn't, and if you do it long enough you'll probably 
get a warning from the eBay police.

<h2>Reporting</h2>


POGs also consolidate reporting, since grouping of sales is done by product. 
In addition order manager lets you run sales reports for orders that contain (or exclude) specific store wide option groups.

<h2>Custom Product SKUs</h2>


The work around to mapping to your own part numbers is to put your part # into the location field, and then print packing slips instead of invoices. (Packing slips contain the location field) - then you can create a completely unique part # for every inventoriable sku.

<h2>The Future</h2>


Also it's worth mentioning there will be an announcement in Feb. that Zoovy through a special program with eBay called .Configurator. will start supporting "choice" listings in select categories (e.g. apparel) but that feature will only be available to 2.0 customers - so you won't be eligible with the type of account you have. 
the operation and interaction of OG's and POG's you'll realize they are very powerful assets.
