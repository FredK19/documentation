1.  Issue with customer reveiving 2 winning bid emails.  There was 2 channels created when the first one was modified on eBay.  if you need to modify a channel, make changes on eBay, then revoke the remaining channels in your Zoovy account

I tried to call you back, but the phone was busy.

Forget what I talked about earlier.  This issue her is, in Powerlister, if you have a tragger price enabled, you must have the Zoovy Gallery enabled.  this has always been the case, but it was not working correctly.   

To enable the Zoovy Gallery, just log into the new Zoovy Ebay Manager tool at

http://ebayapi.zoovy.com/

For the Menu, click on enable eBay Gallery.  

let me know if you have any questions on this

several issues
1. PM can not sync correctly categories.   this is due to custom layout for navigation

2.  shipping weight drop to Zero when products weigh over 150 lbs.
This is a UPS issue.  They do not ship over 150 lbs,  May want to create a rule to disable UPS if weight is over 150 lbs.  


3. Product redirection does not work corectly.  Must click back button twice.  issue here is, use the /category... link, not the www. link

Click on Zoovy Order Manager-

When the username/login window pops up, click on the Admin in the upper left corner-

Select Account Security-

Populate the username and password fields and click Update.

This will force a sync.

All email for lingerie@comcast.net is bouncing from Comcast because too many spammers are targeting addresses at your domains to receive spam.  The legacy mail forwarding to lingerie@comcast.net no longer works.  We haven't supported legacy forwarding for a while and aren't in a position to make it work.  Please update all domains in Domain Hosting that use "Legacy Forwarding" for email to use "ZoovyMail 2.0" or"None" for their email settings.

You probably only use a few email addresses for all of your sites, so many of your specialty domains can use "None" for email.  Add mail aliases in your Webmail account for any domains you set to "ZoovyMail 2.0" where you really do expect to receive email.

If/when you're done making changes, please update this ticket so that I can verify that the settings are correct.

Thanks,
Eric Ziegast

Hello Michael,

We have received your questionnaire regarding the Express custom work that we'll be doing for you.  Everything seems to be in order and I have forwarded it on to a member of our design team.  The design usually takes 5 to 10 working days to put together.  
Once it is ready, I will update this ticket with a link to the design at which point I'll request a pass or fail.  You can read more about the process at the following page in webdoc:

Your tech has informed me that he would like to input some coding in order to prevent right clicking on your site.  I explained to him that we don't generally condone this type of scripting, as it does have a tenancy to break shopping carts and cause various other malfunctions.  Being your site though, if you would like to have him add it he can.  However, should anything need repair, we will have to charge you accordingly in order to do so.

I have consulted with a senior tech, explaining that the code would need to be written into each layout containing images in order to be effective.  Please note, there are several known work arounds that would allow someone to
