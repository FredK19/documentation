<h2> Tracking Information</h2>
Tracking id's let a customer know that an order is on it's way. 
Tracking id's are provided by most shipping methods such as UPS and FedEx. 
US Priority mail uses a feature called Delivery confirmation in conjunction with it's priority mail service. 
Delivery confirmation is free for customers who use Zoovy Order Manager to automatically print their electronic priority tracking.
Customers can be automatically emailed tracking id's as part of order completion using the Zoovy Order Manager. 
Customers can look up tracking id's by logging into their account (assuming you have allowed them to create accounts during checkout).
You can also input (or import) tracking numbers from a variety of 3rd party shopping applications using the Zoov Order Manager for Windows.
