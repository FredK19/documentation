<h1>Converting from Yahoo Store to Zoovy</h1>
<article>
<h2>Data Import</h2>

Zoovy has developed a way to convert a Yahoo search engine file into products in the Zoovy store.
In most cases custom formatting will not be converted to Zoovy.
The following fields can be converted from Yahoo:
<table>
	<tr><td>Product Title</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Product Description (with HTML formatting)</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Product Price</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Product Images</td></tr>
</table>
</article>

<h2>Procedure</h2>

A Yahoo Import can be done by sending a ticket to Zoovy support.
Please provide your Yahoo storename and reference this webdoc. 
In general this takes between 1-2 hours of billable dev time depending on the size of the file, and takes 2-3 business days to complete.
