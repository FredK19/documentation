<h1>Amazon Bundle Overview</h1>

<article>
<h2>Amazon Bundle</h2>





This feature allows you to complete your Amazon orders and track your inventory in the same central location that you use to complete orders from EBay or any other Zoovy supported marketplace, including your webstore.
<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>Zoovy makes it easy to comply with Amazon's 'charge when shipped' policy. By printing your postage in Zoovy Order Manager, your tracking is automatically populated into your order. That information is then transported into your Seller Central account, letting Amazon know that the order has been shipped and therefore you are paid.
</div>
</aside>

Amazon is one of our strongest marketplaces at this time.<br>
The transaction takes place on Amazon. This means that shipping and payment is configured not in Zoovy but in Amazon. The shipping rules that you configure in your Zoovy account will not affect your Amazon syndication orders. (This is not true for Checkout By Amazon)

<h2>Is Amazon right for you?</h2>
We strongly believe in Amazon but it is one of the stricter marketplaces. If you feel you can meet their stringent requirements, it can be a great advent to your company's bottom line.<br>
Amazon does not let everyone into Seller Central. There is an approval process.
<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>You must have a Seller Central account in order to use Zoovy's Amazon syndication.
</div>

Amazon wants good pictures that are not branded with a company logo or URL. They require complete data, including descriptions, prices, pictures, and names. Accurate UPC's are normally required.<br>

Feedback is extremely important to Amazon. They want credible merchants who will complete their orders accurately and in a timely manner.<br>
<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>If you would like Zoovy to submit directly to an existing Amazon listing you must provide the ASIN. If you do not provide the ASIN, Amazon will attempt to guess which listing to merge your product with. If the product details are similar to that of the existing listing, it may successfully merge your product correctly. Without the ASIN however, it may guess incorrectly or even list the product anew. 
</div>
</aside>

Amazon charges based on percentage of sales. Typically this means a larger percentage is taken out than on other marketplaces.<br>

It is not quick to setup but it can be worth the effort.

(http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=1161236)
Amazon Marketplace gives you the chance to list items for sale directly on the product detail page where Amazon.com sells the same item new. Listing is free--you only pay a fee if you sell. allows BMMG (Books, Movies, Music, Games) sales. Zoovy does not integrate directly with Amazon Marketplace.

<h2>Amazon Webstores</h2>
<li>Zoovy has minimal support for Amazon Webstores
<li>Zoovy uploaded products can be placed on the Amazon Webstore through SellerCentral
<li>Orders created via your Amazon Webstore will pulled down the same as your Amazon.com orders
<li>Tracking Info provided by Amazon Webstore will be uploaded to Seller Central from Zoovy as available
<br>
<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
We suggest that if you don't already have an Amazon.com Webstore that you not setup one on Amazon and setup a specialty site within Zoovy. This will eliminate multiple places and accounts to manage.
