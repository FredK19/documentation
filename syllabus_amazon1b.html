<h1>New Amazon Apparel Template</h1>






<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>

The Apparel category has been split into 2 separate templates; "Shoes, Handbags, Glasses/Eyewear" and "Clothing and Accessories".  Merchants who sell shoes, handbags or eye-wear do not have to take any action as they will continue to list their products using the same template as they always have.<br>

Merchants who sell other items in the Apparel category will have to make some changes going forward.<br>

The main changes that Amazon have made are:<br>

<li>Item Type Keywords have replaced "Clothing Type" and "Style Keywords".
<li>Only one department can be added which in most circumstances will be dictated by the "Item Type Keyword" chosen
<li>A few additional "not required" attributes have been added.

<h2>Updating products that are currently listed on Amazon</h2>

Although it is important to upgrade your products as soon as possible, products can continue to syndicate using the old catalog and therefore merchants should take the necessary time to ensure the changes are made correctly.<br>

To update the products the following steps should be taken:<br>

1.  Select "Clothing and Accessories" from the "Amazon Product Type" drop down list and click Save.<br>
2.  Click on "Enter Specifics".  (All of the specifics that had been entered under the previous template will be copied over to the new template.<br>
3.  Click here to open the <a href="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/rainier/help/btg/apparel_browse_tree_guide.xls">Amazon Apparel Browse Tree Guide</a><br>
4.  Click on the "Apparel" tab.<br>
5.  Column B lists all of the Clothing and Accessories categories.  Select the category that you would like to sell your product in.<br>


<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div> It is best to select a category that is as far down the browse tree as possible.  For example, if the product is a boys skateboard hoodie it is better to select "\Clothing & Accessories/Novelty & Special Use/Sports Clothing/Skateboarding/Boys/Hoodies" than "\Clothing & Accessories/Novelty & Special Use/Sports Clothing/Skateboarding/Boys".

</div>
</aside>

<br>

7.  Take the corresponding "department name" and "item_type_keyword" from Column C and enter their values into the "Department" and "Item Type" fields in the "Enter Specifics" section.  In the previous example the values would be "boys" and "skateboarding-hoodies" respectively.  If the chosen category does not have a corresponding department, select the department from the drop down list that best fits your product.<br>

<aside class="hint">

<div>For those who are comfortable using the csv product upload tool, the Item Type Keywords and Departments can be added in bulk using the attributes "amz:prod_cloth_cd_itemtype" and "amz:prod_cloth_cd_dpt".
</div>
</aside>
 <br>

8.  Complete any other fields that are relevant to the product you are selling.<br>
