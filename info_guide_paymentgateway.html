<h2>Why do I need a Payment Gateway?</h2>
Payment gateways authorize credit card transactions over the internet in real time.  The card number is input through the checkout system and goes immediately to the gateway for authorization.  Your customer is then immediately charged, or the card is denied.  The funds are processed each night and deposited to your account.  The time it takes to have the funds in your account depends on your payment gateway and merchant account.
