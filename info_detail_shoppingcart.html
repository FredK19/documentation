<h1>Shopping Cart Details</h1>

<h2>Retention</h2>

<h2>Cookies</h2>

Zoovy uses a combination of cookies, and server side rewrites and therefore 
does not require cookies, provided the wrapper is designed correctly. 
If you designed your own wrapper, or use any absolute links in your website design then your site will require cookies.
Cookies are used to track customers carts as they move throughout a merchants site.
<br>
When operating in a cookieless mode, Customers can purchase one item (or multiple incomplete [auction] items), 
without cookies and proceed through checkout without issue. They can also 
add any item which is on the shopping cart page, however if the customer does not have cookies 
they will not be able to purchase other items available throughout the website, unless it is all done from the cart page.

<h2>Maximizing Site Performance</h2>

The #1 reason for abandoned shopping carts is slow and unresponsive pages.
Before I start - remember that no matter how fast your site is, it will always be slow to somebody somewhere - Zoovy 
goes to great lengths to provide an always available, high performance website for your growing business.<br><br>

There are serveral things you can do to improve page load times:

<b>How to speed up your zoovy store</b>
<li> Decrease the number of products on pages with a lot of content. 
<li> Reduce the size of the thumbnails (which are currently quite large). Obviously it's a trade off - because bigger thumbnails do tend to sell more products. People with higher speed connections often expect heavy pages with a lot of detail.
<li> Whenever possible use a click to zoom image, rather than an static large image.
<li> If you have inventory being displayed turning that off the display can also improve performance.
<li> Each time you alter your site Zoovy will need to rebuild cache files of your site, this can result in slow site performance immediately after a change has been made (while those cache files are redistributed to each webserver).
<li> If you have large categories, consider using the multi-page functionality of a product lsit.
<li> If people are reporting slow searches then consider using the advanced site search feature which will perform much faster indexing and subsequent searching of your site.
<li> Finally, if your customers are complaining it takes too long to find items consider reorganizing your navigation. A good website will take only three clicks to find any item, anything after that is considered "slow" - in some cases too much categorization can hurt you. Consider breaking unrelated products and product lines into separate websites. 
<li> If customers are reporting slow checkouts consider changing gateways or shipping methods (both can cause checkout to become very slow).
