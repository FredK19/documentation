<h1>Design &amp; Custom Development: Warranty Policy</h1>

<article>
<h2>Concept Overview</h2>







This document outlines the Zoovy warranty specifically relating to billable design or development done on behalf of an individual client.

<br>

Unless explicitly stated elsewhere in the development agreement, all recipients of billable design or development work agree to this policy.  This document outlines Zoovy's obligations and policies regarding corrections during, and following the warranty period.

<h2>Types of Development</h2>


<section>
<h3>Design Only</h3>
Design Only means the project is purely cosmetic, and can be done with graphics, style-sheets.  No development of program logic is required. 
</section>

<section>
<h3>Core</h3>
Core Development refers to enhancements made on behalf of one client to the platform. Core enhancements are available to all clients. 
<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>
If functionality is added to the core, Zoovy is only obligated to maintain that for the period outlined in the Platform Upgrade Exclusion.  If functionality is disabled or removed, then the Platform Upgrade Exclusion shall apply. 

</div>
</aside>


<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
Core development projects may be cancelled or later removed if they are deemed to adversely impact other clients using the platform, more information can be found here: 
<a class="linkdoc" href="#?doc=50905">Doc 50905</a>

</div>
</aside>


</section>

<section>
<h3>Hosted</h3>
Hosted Development refers to applications developed to be run on a separate hosting server. 
<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>
Unlike the Zoovy backend these hosting servers are non-redundant, and are not covered by the ESLA.

</section>

<section>
<h3>Third-Party Integration</h3>
Third Party Integration is any application which connects to another non-supported application, or relies on any libraries, or special software functionality which was not developed as part of the project.  

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
A list of approved vendors (who are typically built into the core) is available at:
<a class="linkdoc" href="#?doc=50850">Doc 50850</a>

</div>
</aside>


<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>
Even if a third-party software provider is integrated into the core, it does not obligate Zoovy to provide support for features not explicitly mentioned, or new features added after the completion of the project.  

</div>
</aside>


</section>


<section>
<h3>Widget</h3>
A widget is considered any application which executes on a client's browser. 
This includes but is not limited to any javascript, flash, or silverlight functionality.

<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>
Open source JavaScript or flash libraries which were not developed by Zoovy are considered Third-Party Integration.  This is because the projects are billed only for the integration time, not for the development of the actual library. 

</div>
</aside>


</section>



</article>

<article>
<h2>Warranty Period</h2>

<section>
<h3>Design</h3>
Design projects have a 30 day warranty on functionality, starting from deployment.
<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
A 30 day warranty is sufficient because Zoovy provides preliminary testing and quality assurance prior to the completion of a website.

</div>
</aside>


Any TOXML (zoovy template, including but not limited to themes, layouts, wizards and emails) file that has been edited/saved by the customer will void any warranty offered by Zoovy.

</section>

<section>
<h3>Development</h3>
Development projects have a 90 day warranty on any development hosted on Zoovy servers. This is a general defect warranty that covers issues which may not have been immediately evident such as log file removal, general error handling, or cases which may not have been encountered within the testing profile.
</section>

<section>
<h3>Third-Party Exclusions</h3>

If a third party provider changes or updates their API during the project development, during the warranty period which impacts the application, this shall void the warranty.

<br>

If integration interface, library files, or other supporting elements were changed by a third party, the warranty period immediately expires.  Zoovy will, under no circumstances, be obligated to maintain compatibility with non-supported 3rd parties.

<br>

If 3rd party API was down, or unavailable resulting in the outage - the time involved in diagnosing, or working around the situation will be considered "out of warranty", however the warranty period will endure. 

<br>

If a provider is removed from the approved BPP provider list, and a general announcement is posted to the Recent News at www.zoovy.com, then all warranties related to that provider shall expire 30 days from the removal date.

</section>


<section>
<h3>Platform Upgrade Exclusion</h3>
For a period of 1 year from the beginning of the project, Zoovy will treat any issues  caused as a result of a Zoovy platform upgrade as in-warranty.  However if the functionality cannot be restored Zoovy shall only be obligated to provide a pro-rated amount of the project based on the total project price, and the remainder of the warranty period. 
</section>

<section>
<h3>Non-Usable Exclusion</h3>

For projects within warranty, if the software is not usable then the warranty period is extended until the changes can be implemented. 

<br>
The extension must be explicitly requested by the customer within 5 business days 
of the resolution of an issue, and the issue must have lasted more than 2 business days in duration. 

</section>

</article>





<article>
<h2>Types of Changes &amp; Fees</h2>


<section>
<h3>Within Warranty Period</h3>

There are no charges for fixes made within the warranty period.  

<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>
This does not apply to changes or enhancements that were not specifically outlined in the accepted proposal. 

</div>
</aside>

</section>

<section>
<h3>Beyond Warranty Period</h3>
Changes made outside the warranty period are subject to Zoovy's normal billable rates, including any discounts the client may be eligible for. 
</section>

<section>
<h3>Emergency (High-Priority) Escalation</h3>

High Priority Escalation have a 1 business day acknowledgment time, with a target of a 3 business day resolution.  
<br>

There is a $250 minimum fee for high priority repairs, in addition to any billable hours billed at 2x the normal rate. 

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
Since an engineer is immediately notified of a high priority issue, in many cases the resolution will be dramatically faster. 

</div>
</aside>


</section>



<section>
<h3>Critical Software</h3>

This describes any piece of functionality which renders a high volume business unable to operate until it is restored.  "Critical Software Projects" are explicitly designated as "Critical" in the proposal and throughout the project. 

<br>

With a critical project additional investment is made by the client to ensure robust error handling, to facilitate remediation of errors, in addition to the extra levels of testing and quality assurance the software will undergo prior to production.  
Critical software has no implicit warranty period, and instead is covered by ongoing maintenance fees to maintain and extend the warranty period indefinitely.

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
Generally the difference between Critical vs. Non-Critical projects is approximately double the project cost. Maintenance contracts which extend the warranty will generally run 25% of the total project cost per year, but are subject to approval and custom pricing on a per project basis.  

</div>
</aside>


<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
In general repairs to Critical Software should *always* be escalated to high priority (emergency) by the client.  If the client requests "normal priority" within the warranty period, the normal billing rates apply.

</div>
</aside>


<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
Since critical projects (by definition) are always within warranty, small repairs can be submitted as low priority issues (via our online ticket queue) and will not be billed. 

</div>
</aside>


<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>
Critical software becomes non-critical if the client opts to discontinue the maintenance fees on the software, regardless of how the software was designed. 

</div>
</aside>


</section>


<section>
<h3>Non-Critical Software</h3>

This describes any software which was not explicitly classified as Critical by the proposal.  Non-critical software has a 5 business day acknowledgment time, no estimated resolution times will be provided.  

<br>

No fees during the warranty period.  Following the warranty period normal billing rates apply. 

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
Review the "Non-Usable Exclusion" earlier in this document to understand how the warranty is extended if the software is broken during the warranty period.

</div>
</aside>


<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>
During a repair, if a client demands a same business day status/update on a resolution, the client is also directly authorizing Zoovy to move the status to high priority/emergency, and is also implicitly agreeing to fees and policies outlined in the Emergency/High Priority Escalation. Zoovy is only obligated to provide same business day turn-around on Escalated Requests.

<h2>Future Technology Disclaimer</h2>

Certain technologies are outside of our standard warranty policies.  These technologies include any ajax or advanced javascript of any kind.  

<br>

In addition, certain technologies may have long term support costs that come along with them.  These technologies include, but are not limited to, javascript, ajax and custom carts.

<br>

Typically, these technologies are deployed in a manner that makes them integral to the performance and usability of the storefront.  Zoovy developers/designers may be required to upgrade your custom templates (with or without your approval) to ensure proper performance as certain technologies progress.  These changes will be billed at the DEV or GFX rate, depending on the nature of the change and what skill-level employee is required. Typically, you'll be made aware of these updates after they're made.
