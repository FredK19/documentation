<h2>Usage</h2>


To setup your scale it must be connected to a work serial port on your computer. 

You must designate which serial port the scale is on, and the type of scale and then press the setup button, which will

test to see if your scale is working properly. 

When you press the weigh button it will cause the software to read the weight of whatever is currently on the scale.

<h2>Getting your scale supported</h2>


Order manager has the ability to capture data coming from an unknown scale. This data can be sent to the Zoovy developers

and may be included in a future release of our product. Zoovy makes a best effort to provide support for all make and models

of serial driven scales - however we encourage our merchants to use scales which are already compatible. 

<br>

<br>

To grab the output from a scale, select "New/Unknown Scale Model" from the list and press the setup button.

If the scale is turned on, and sending data to the computer the order manage will display "Successful Communication". 

Located in the order manager subdirectory you will find a scaledebug.txt, please create a support ticket and upload

that file along with a make and model of the scale, and if possible a link where to purchase the scale. <br>

<br>

If the message "Unsuccessful communication" is displayed, then you should check the scale to make sure it is properly

connected, and if it is configurable that it is operating at 9600 baud, No Parity, 8 bits, 1 stop bit. 

If you are still unable to get the scale working, you may be able to send the scale to with Zoovy with shipping paid 

by you, both directions and we will attempt to get it working on our end - no guarantee of compatibility is made, but

we're pretty good at this stuff. ;-)
