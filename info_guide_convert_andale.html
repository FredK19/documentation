<h2>Data Import</h2>

Data import can be accomplished by exporting your listings using the Andale Lister Pro.
<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>

Andale Lister Pro does not properly handle CR/LFs when exporting to a CSV format.
Instead export to Excel first and then use Excel to export to a CSV. (bug confirmed: version 2.6 build 153)

If you recieve errors during the export to excel you are pretty much screwed.<br>
<br>
Since Andale does not properly escape tabs or commas in it's export
if either character appears in your data you will not be able to
import the data into any other application. We'd like to a take a second
and point out that this is not a "zoovy thing" it's a standard escaping sequence that Andale isn't following,
and because of it you will not be able to import the data into either
Microsoft Access or Microsoft Excel either (NOTE: if you get the data into either of those
applications, it's a snap to get it into Zoovy).<br>
<br>
Our advice is contact Andale Technical support - thats about all you can do.
NOTE1: it seems if you have HTML in your data, you will not be able to
export to Excel. <br>
NOTE2: you cannot export selected workbooks because the Andale lister can
only display 250 items at a time (so if any folders have>250 items those
will be lost)<br>

You can also simply request an import of your running eBay auctions.
Please read the details on importing listings from eBay.com

This probably won't get all your data, but at least it will provide a starting point.

<h2>Getting Acclimated</h2>

A few helpful hints to get you started using Zoovy:<br>
<li> Zoovy manages everything as products and orders orders rather than simply listings.
An order contains one or more products, along with a single shipping, and payment type.
<li> What Andale calls "Pending Sales" are called "Incomplete Items" in Zoovy.<br>
<li> eBay listings are created from channels, and channnels are created from products.
(A product is a container for multiple channels)
