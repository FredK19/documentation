<h2>Why Combine Orders</h2>

Order combination lets you take an order, and combine it with one or more other orders. This feature is mainly used to combine orders from the same customer that are not yet shipped to create savings on shipping costs. Please note that combined orders do not need to be from the same customer. However, the parent order will retain all customer contact, billing, and shipping information.
