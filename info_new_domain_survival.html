<h2>WAIT!</h2>
Did you fill out your Company Information completely? You should have done this back when you were doing the basic setup of your account, but double-check just in case. Go to Setup > Site Builder and Edit your Company Information. If this is not filled out, you are not going to be able to complete the following steps.

<h2>Step 1: Setup Zoovymail</h2>
A newly registered domain will appear in your Zoovymail account, if you have one. Please take a moment to ensure that you have Zoovymail enabled before registering a new domain. See <a class="linkdoc" href="#?doc=50268">Doc 50268</a> for steps to provisioning a Zoovymail account if you need further help with this step.

<h2>Step 2: Register Domain</h2>
Go to Setup > Domain Hosting and click on the Add Domains button. On the following screen, click on the Register button. Enter the domain that you want without the leading "www." For example, if you wanted your domain to be "www.zoovy.com" you would just enter "zoovy.com"

<h2>Step 3: Configure Domain</h2>
Once you have the domain entered, it will appear under Setup > Domain Hosting > Domain Config. You will want to Edit Configuration on your newly purchased domain. Select the appropriate Email and Hosting mode and save.
