<h2>Getting Started</h2>

Zoovy Order Manager allows you to setup preferences, special payment types, add users and much more.  For now we will concentrate on setting up the basics to get started.
</article>
<article>
<h2>Tools</h2>

Under the drop down tools menu you will find general information, email manager, and label setup.  There are other options here, but lets focus on general information and label setup. 
</article>
<article>
<h2>General Information</h2>

The general information tab allows you to modify and save company information which was downloaded from web manager during synchronization. 
You can edit company address, phone numbers and contact information under the admin menu. Just select edit company information and make your updates there.  
<br>
This information appears on the printed invoice and packing slip.
At this time no other customization to the invoice is possible. 
There is no invoice "designer" view in Order Manager. 
If you want to do that you will need to export the invoices into a format such as Microsoft 
Word, Excel, or Quickbooks by Intuit where you can design a custom invoice.

<h2>IMPORTANT NOTE:</h2>

Company Synchronization for the Windows Client is DOWNLOAD ONLY which means
any changes you make the Order Management client WILL NOT appear on the website.

<h2>Label Printer Setup</h2>

Zoovy Order Manager allows you to print shipping labels from your processed orders.  Under the tools drop down menu, select label printer setup.  Specify the type of shipping label you will use by clicking the radio button next to the label size.  Select the logo tab if you would like to upload a custom logo that will print on your shipping labels.  You must then select a printer for your changes to save.  Click the printer icon and select the printer from your operating system files.

<h2>Adding a User</h2>

You can add users to your Zoovy system. Users have the ability to edit orders, send email, process
payments, print invoices, etc. in fact they can do everything EXCEPT login to your Zoovy account
and change your store. This protects your business against un-authorized changes.
<aside class="caution">

<div>If a user account has "Require Package Verification" checked that user will not be able to print airbills in Zoovy Order Manager until all contents of the package have been scanned.

<h2>Change Admin Password</h2>

The administrator password should ALWAYS be the same as your Zoovy account. You should only change
this if you have also changed the password on the Zoovy server. NOTE: all new passwords MUST be
authenticated by the Zoovy server.
</article>

<article>
<h2>Company Logo</h2>

Normally Order Manager will download the company logo from your website. Because
the logo used in Order Manager will appear on invoices it is recommended that you
change the logo to one that is more suitable for printing. Logos can be in either BMP, GIF, and
JPEG, ICO and CUR format. The image will be scaled to approximately 140 x 140 pixels and should have either
a transparent or white background for best printing results.

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
NOTE: The company logo entered will NOT be uploaded to your the Website it will ONLY be used
for printing invoices.

<h2>Preferences</h2>

In the preferences areas you can permit users to edit recent orders. This is not recommended.
You can also configure the Invoice Footer Message which is displayed at the bottom of each
invoice and packing slip.
</article>
<article>
<h2>Reset Database</h2>

The Reset Database tool is a maintenance tool that allows you to destroy all
local information and completely clear your database. Doing this will cause Order
Manager to automatically download all of your information from the Zoovy servers. Using
this tool will cause you to lose any changes you have made since the last synchronization.
You should not use this tool unless instructed to by Zoovy technical support.
