<h2>User Accounts</h2>
When you set up Windows, you were required to create a user account. 
This account is an administrator account, which allows you to set up 
your computer and install any programs that you would like to use. Once 
you have finished setting up your computer, we recommend that you create 
a standard account and use it for your everyday computing. If you create 
new user accounts, you should also make them standard accounts. Using 
standard accounts will help keep your computer more secure.<br>

The steps that you should follow will vary, depending on whether your 
computer is on a domain or a workgroup. To find out, see "To check if 
your computer is on a workgroup or domain" in How is a network at home 
different from one at work?
