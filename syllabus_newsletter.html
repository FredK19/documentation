</article>
<article>
<h2>PREREQUISITES</h2>
You must complete the Domain Hosting training before taking this course.
<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>If when you click on Newsletter Management, you get a message saying that you must configure your domain for newsletters you will need to:
<li> Go to Setup > Domain Hosting > Domain Config
<li> Expand the domain that you will be sending emails from
<li> Under "Newsletter Alias", setup an email alias that you want the newsletters to come from by default.<br>
This should let you go onto the next step, setting up a subscription list.

<h2>Subscription Lists</h2>
With Zoovy's Newsletter Feature, you have the capability to maintain up to 15 different subscription lists. This is a way to manage 15 different newsletters to 15 different groups easily and in one place.<BR><BR>
<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
Customers will only be given an option to subscribe to your list(s) if they create a new account at checkout. The option to subscribe is given on the same page as password creation. This means that your Checkout Settings must be set at "Nice", "Strict" or "Default" and the customer must choose to create a new account. If the customer already has an account created, they will not have an option to change the subscription settings at checkout.

</div>
</aside>

<BR><BR>
There are three types of subscription lists:
<BR><BR>
<LI>DEFAULT - anytime a customer subscribes to any list, add them to this one too. 
<LI>TARGETED - allows the customer to select this group during checkout (the default is OFF - they must check the box to be subscribed). **Most often used.**
<LI>EXCLUSIVE - customer cannot add themselves to this list - you will add them to the list rather than them being allowed to signup during checkout. (Most often used for Wholesale mailings)
<BR><BR>

<h2>Campaigns</h2>
Campaigns are another term for Newsletter Mailings. They are created to send emails/newsletters to your customers. Campaigns can be set up in 5 simple steps:
<BR><BR>
Step 1: Setup the basics of your campaign.<BR>
<LI>Enter the name you will use to refer to this Campaign (customers will not see this - only for your reference). 
<LI>Select the Source email (i.e., where the newsletter appears to come from).
<LI>Subject: This is the subject of the mailing - enter it as you would like your customers to see it in their Inbox.
<LI>Source Profile: Select the profile with which the newsletter is associated. If you are not using specialty sites/additional profiles, you can leave this to DEFAULT. 
<LI>Wholesale Price Schedule - This setting adjusts prices for any products listed in the newsletter to reflect any wholesale pricing adjustments. For example, if you are sending a newsletter to a group of your wholesale customers that are all on Schedule A, you could select that schedule here, and all prices would reflect the prices specified on Schedule A.
<LI>Schedule Countdown - Countdown refers to the frequency the specified Schedule is applied to the email. That is, if your Schedule specifies that there is a $5 off and you select "5", only the first 5 orders will be given the $5 off. 
<LI>Recipients - Specify which group, or Subscription List, will be receiving this newsletter. 
<BR><BR>
<aside class="caution">
<h6>IMPORTANT</h6>
<div>
When configuring the Recipients portion, please carefully select from the list.  Consider, the purpose or use of the Campaign. Many customers in the past have selected a specific Subscription List for Recipients, which only included a handful of customers, when in actuality, the campaign was intended to notify ALL Subscribers. This happens often - Take a moment to be sure that your newsletter is going to the right group of people!

<BR><BR>
Step 2 - Choose a Page Layout. <BR><BR>
Click SELECT beside the layout that you would like to use for your newsletter. If you have a custom layout, it will appear at the top with a "~" delimiter. Otherwise, select from one of the general layouts available here. 
<BR><BR>
<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div> Don't see a layout that will work for you? Our design team can build one to match your store, or one that meets your needs. Visit the <A HREF="http://proshop.zoovy.com/product/CSTM_NEWSLETTER">Zoovy ProShop</A> for more details.
</div>
</aside>

<BR><BR>
Step 4 - Edit the Content in Your Layout.
From here, you can build the newsletter just as you have previously worked within the Site Builder. Add information, images, text, and products as necessary. The information that appears at the bottom of the email, with your business name, phone, address, and the text is not removable and insures that you are compliant with SPAM regulations.<BR><BR>
Click on the Preview/Send Test to move to step 4. 
<BR><BR>
Step 4 - Preview/Send Test.<BR><BR>
On this page, you can see a preview of what your newsletter will look like, in HTML and in a text only reader. In order to send the newsletter, we require you to send a TEST to yourself first. This insures that you have seen the newsletter in it's environment and know what it looks like before sending it out to the masses, and discover an error.  Populate your email address in the test field and click the send test button. Check your email to see the newsletter. Review it carefully for prices, text, spelling, etc. If it looks as you would like, Click the APPROVE link at the top of the test newsletter.<BR><BR>
Step 5 - Schedule Your Campaign .<BR><BR>
Ok, you are happy with the newsletter and you have approved it. Now, you select when it should go out, up to 7 days in the future. The newsletter will remain in the PENDING section of your Newsletter Management until it is QUEUED. Then it will be sent, and will move into the Finished section. Here, you will see statistics on your newsletter, including:<BR><BR>
<li> Emails Sent: this tracks the total number of emails Zoovy sent on your behalf. 
<li> Emails Received: the number of people who opened the message.
<li> Emails Bounced: the number of emails which were returned as undeliverable (note: these subscribers are automatically unsubscribed).
<li> Emails Unknown: the number of emails that were neither opened or returned as undeliverable, i.e., people probably deleted them from their mailbox before opening
<li> Click thrus: the number of people who opened the message and clicked one or more links.
<li> Sale Count: this tracks the number of sales that were generated by the click thrus.
<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
Orders created from your Newsletter Campaign will have the following in the link indicator:<br><br>
META: @CAMPAIGN:####:#####
<br><br>
The first number is the Campaign number and the second number is the customer number.

</div>
</aside>

<BR><BR>
<li> Sale Total: this tracks the total dollar in sales which were generated by the click throughs. 
<li> Unsubscribes: this is people who clicked on the unsubscribe link and opted out of receiving future newsletters due to this campaign. Note: Customers can also unsubscribe to newsletters when they are logged into your site by clicking "Account Management: Email Settings".
<BR><BR>This information is useful to gauge the success of your campaign.

<h2>Recommendations</h2>
Each business is unique and you should decide what works best for you, but below are some best practicies. The copy, design, and offer are what entices your customers to open, read, and take action on the email.   Try some of the following.
<br>

<li> Use creative subject lines (ex. Fall Into Savings and Get 20% Off, Holiday Shopping Kick off - Get Free Shipping on Your Order!, Fall Clearance, Last Day...,Secret Sale)
<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>This is one of the easiest ways to increase revenue; write a great subject line.
</div>
</aside>

<li> Make sure the email is reflective of your store. Consumers should recognize the email is from your company.
<li> Have options; numerous products or categories. Shoppers like choices but don't overdue it.
<li> Have plenty of links; make it easy for them to get to the site and shop.
<li> Use graphic images and buttons, which easily draw attention and convey the message visually.

<br>
Make sure  you give your subscribers what they want, and only send emails to subscribers.  Buying lists of email addresses can be considered spammy, and those subscribers would have no familiarity with your company.  Test different promotions and combos.  Make sure to be consistent and, at a minimum, send 2 promotions a month.  This does not mean you have to give a coupon or discount.  It could promote hot items, clearance, free shipping, etc. Just make its relevant, valuable and it will increase your revenue.
