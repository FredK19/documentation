<h1>Syllabus: Favicon (Optional)</h1>

<h2>Favicon Configuration</h2>


A favicon (short for "favorites icon") is an icon associated with a particular webstore. Browsers that support favicons may display them in the browser's URL bar and next to the site's name in lists of bookmarks.

A favicon is a 16 pixel by 16 pixel image saved with the file name and extension: favicon.icon This file is then uploaded in Zoovy to your Custom Files Library.
("Setup">>"Custom Files Library")  FYI - The library is also referred to the "Public Files Library" in Setup.

A favicon may not appear instantly upon upload.  Currently, all profiles/partitions share the same favicon unless a custom theme is used, in which case custom favicons can be implemented.
