<h1>Digital Downloads Manager</h1>

<article>
<h2>Concept Overview</h2>


The digital downloads manager is an optional module (which can be customized on a per client basis as necessary) that allows users to purchase products which correspond to one or more files that can be downloaded after the sale.

<h2>How it works</h2>

<aside class="cbc">
<h6></h6>
<div>

<li> The digital downloads application is installed on a hosting server.
<li> The store owner is given an access URL, plus a login and password
<li> A supplier (e.g. DOWNLOAD) is created in the store, and pointed at the hosting server.
<li> One or more products is associated with the DOWNLOAD supplier in the store.
<li> The store owner uploads a file and associates with a PRODUCTID that was associated with the DOWNLOAD supplier.  
<li> If necessary, multiple files can be associated with a single PRODUCTID
<li> When orders are placed (and typically flagged as paid) they are automatically dispatched via supply chain to the DOWNLOAD supplier.
<li> The digital downloads module receives the supply chain dispatch and sends one email per file to the client.

Unfortunately we will not install this application on non-Zoovy servers.

Although this is billed as a custom project, a normal version of the application (with no changes) can be installed in just a few days.

<li> admin interface displays a list of recent orders which have been received.
<li> The email sent by the digital downloads application is customizable.

Since this application is stored on a hosting server, additional customization can be done to this application for a fee.  The program is developed in Perl/CGI.

This product is *NOT* part of the core Zoovy system and does not qualify for free electronic support.
