<h1>Navigation Categories</h1>
<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>

Navigation Categories, sometimes called navcats are how you separate and organize your products logically on your Zoovy store. Done properly, this helps your customers view items quickly and intuitively. This is the most common way of looking at products online. You must remember a few things when seperating your products
into website navigation categories.

People generally do not want to click more then three categories deep. Keep your products separated,
but do not segregate the product so much that you have only one product in a category. Think of your navigation as groups of common items. Usability studies have determined that more than 7 choices on any given page will cause the user to go into information overload and become confused. In addition, too many categories will make the user perceive the site as busy or the site will take too long to load.

<h2>Upsell Where Possible</h2>

List items that the customer may need with the product that they are purchasing, if they need batteries with the toy, have batteries listed on the same page.  You will want customers able to find the products that they are looking for, when they come to your site. If they have to search through too many navigation categories they will not want to come back.  Keeping your products well organized lets the customer find what they are looking for quickly and enjoy their shopping experience at your site.<br>

  The search tab on your Zoovy store is not accessed by your website navigation 
  categories, but rather by navigation groups. The search option allows your customer 
  to search by something other then the navigation categories that you have separated 
  your products into.
