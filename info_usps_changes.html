<h2>Changes to USPS international shipping options</h2>


The United States Postal Service is making major changes to its international mail retail products.  First-Class Mail, Priority Mail and Express Mail will now be included in the international product portfolio for retail customers.  USPS has more information about the details of these changes at this address.<br>

<h2>How does this affect Zoovy merchants?</h2>

There will be an increase in the rates for First Class Mail.  Merchants that have weight based shipping built out for first class mail will need to review the rate increase and make changes as appropriate. Feel free to schedule an appointment if you need assistance with this issue. <br>

USPS has a PDF of all the new rates at http://pe.usps.gov/RateCase2007/Notice123_PDF/Notice123.pdf.<br>

As of May 14th, USPS will no longer offer the options of Global Priority Mail or Air Mail.  As a result, sellers on eBay that have international options of global priority mail and air mail should receive error messages relating to shipping options.  Merchants that receive these errors should remove these shipping options by going to Setup > Shipping > USPS and de-selecting them.

An announcement will be made on Zoovy "Recent News" when changes are made to the Zoovy interface reflecting the changes that the USPS has made.
