<h2>Catalog vs. Substring comparison</h2>
The zoovy engine supports different types of search engines.
By default a store uses a simple substring search - which only searches sku's and titles but can do partial matching e.g. "ATA" would return the word "cATAlog" and "dATA".

<br>

substring is very basic, but requires no tuning, generally speaking businesses will want to configure a search catalog for optimal results. 

<br>

substring doesn't have support for word stemming, e.g. it can't tell the difference between cat and cats.
substring doesn't have support for soundex so it can't work around typos.
substring doesn't have support for a thesaurus file (words which also mean the same as another word). 

<br>

Unfortunately the catalog engine uses a combination of word stemming and soundex which breaks words to a more primitive form of mnemonics for sounds to solve those problems .. so there are no substrings.  To get the advantage of one, you have to give up the other. 

<br>

Clients can tune search catalogs, to use multiple fields such as manufacturer, manufacturer part #, keywords, tags and more.   That way commonly searched for tags, brands, or other words which would also be found with a substring search will still show up. There is a lot you can do to improve search results which on many sites will have a direct impact on boosting sales.
