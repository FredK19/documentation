<h2>About Froogle.com</h2>

Froogle, also known as GoogleBase, is the shopping service for Google.
By focusing entirely on product search, Froogle applies the power of Google's search technology to a very specific
task: locating stores that sell the item you want to find and pointing you directly to the place where you can
make a purchase. <br>
<br>
Froogle normally searches the web for products (through a process called spidering), however Zoovy has the ability
to submit products into Froogle's database.

<h2>Usage</h2>

Once you have registered with Froogle you will be emailed a username, and password, along with an 
FTP server location. You should put the username, password, filename, and ftp server location into your Zoovy store configuration
by going to the Syndication menu and choose the Froogle Icon from the list of feeds on the page. Within 24 hours Zoovy will submit all products on your website to Froogle. <br><br>Hint: When entering the ftp server location, you do not need to include "ftp://"<br><br>

There is no need for the password to be secure on the setup page - the protocol they use (FTP) is insecure,
and the way they send it to you (email) isn't secure either.

To view it - somebody would need to hack into your Zoovy account - and IF they
got in there - stealing your froogle username/password is probably the least
interesting thing to do.

You will receive an email the first time we submit your file, you should forward that email to Froogle to get your
data feed approved.  After that Zoovy will continue to submit your products to Froogle every 72 hours.<br><br>

Keep in mind that by default, we will syndicate all of your products to Froogle.  If you wish to disable specific products from
appearing on Froogle, go to the Products Menu and select the Product you wish to remove from the feed.  In the product editor, remove
the checkbox where it says "Froogle" and your product will be omitted from the feed to Froogle.<br><br>

To view items in your Froogle store, simply go to http://www.froogle.com and type "store:[your store name]" into the search field (where [your store name] represents the froogle store you submitted. Make sure there is not a space between the colon and your store name).<br><br>

If Froogle issues errors, login to Froogle by going to http://www.google.com/merchant and login. You will see a summary of your froogle account, including the errors which you received. From there you may be able to determine how to fix the error.

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>

You can cause the file to be resubmitted within 24 hours by updating your Froogle username, password or FTP server
(you don't have to change them, simply resubmit them).

<b>Maximize Your Froogle</b><br><br>In order to get the most from your Froogle Syndication feed, you may want to consider the following strategies.<br><br>

<i>Product Creation Strategy</i><br><br>

Search Froogle for your own items, using keywords that you believe customers would to find you. If you cannot find your items, odds are that your customers would not be able to either. Try to change the keywords in your Product Name and Product Description to be more easily found. By changing and saving, Zoovy will automatically update your feed upon the next submission to Froogle.<br><br>

Use the Froogle merchant center for identifying any errors with your data feed. Although the Froogle merchant center is simple � it does provide excellent information to assist in correcting data feed issues. To access the Froogle Merchant Center go to http://froogle.google.com and click on the Information for Merchants link.<br><br>

Write a product name that uses a general product name, the brand name, model name, manufacturer and product type. Think about how potential buyers will search for your product and use these identifiers. Remember the Product Names and Product Descriptions are the same names and descriptions used on your Zoovy website.<br><br>

Keep the description around 40 � 60 characters. Recent research shows that a shorter description leads to a better position � possibly a factor of keyword relevancy.<br><br>

Froogle does not accept images that are 90x90 or smaller. So if you do not have a larger image, then simply do not submit one. The best thing to do is send Froogle the same full-size image on your web page and they will re-size it to fit their interface.<br><br>

Do not include shipping information in your product description. This can cause a product to be rejected by Froogle.<br><br>

When naming your image files, the name you give it is very important. Similar to alt tags for conventional search engine optimization, the image should use the primary product keyword such as laptop.gif or beltbuckle.gif in its name.<br><br>

You can optimize your rankings by including all relevant information about your products in your data feed. Include all relevant product information in your Froogle Syndication: Enter Specifics portion of your product editor. If you have information for optional data fields like brand or ISBN, include it.<br><br>

<i>Pricing Strategy</i><br><br>Froogle allows customers to sort search results by Price � either Low to High or High to Low. This makes pricing strategy another way to jockey for position on Froogle.
While on Froogle, perform a search of some common keywords that customers will use to find your products. If it is possible to offer some of your goods at a price less than those listed, you have the chance to have your products appear first for customers who sort by Price: Low to High.<br><br>

A somewhat controversial strategy is to go the opposite way and have the highest price for a certain set of common search words. If you feel that you are offering items of higher quality than other sellers with the same search words, setting your prices as some of the highest would allow your product to appear on the first pages when a customer sorts by Price: High to Low. This, of course, will only generate more business for you if your products are justifiably more expensive and not simply the same thing with an inflated price.<br><br>

All prices should be entered in the Products database of your Zoovy account. By changing the Base Price (i.e., Sell For Price) in your Zoovy account, you automatically change the asking price in your Froogle Syndication Feed.<br><br>

<i>AdWords</i><br><br>Froogle lists certain company URL�s in the right column of the search results page. If you wish to have your company appear there, you can pay to do so. For more on this service, known as AdWords go to https://adwords.google.com/select/<br>
