<h2>Issue #159999: Image changes not propagating</h2>

I have updated as an image on my site.  
How long will it take for this image to propagate across all of your servers?

<br>

To me these show as 2 different images:
<aside class="html">
<h6></h6>
<code>
http://static.zoovy.com/merchant/xxx/checkout.jpg
https://static.zoovy.com/merchant/xxx/checkout.jpg

</code>
</aside>


</article>

<h2>Resolution</h2>
They show as the same to me. 

You might try shift refreshing, or possibly changing the image name.  The caching servers shouldn't hold cache through a SHIFT -Refresh

<br>

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
Zoovy returns HTTP headers that state the images will *never* change, we do this for Search Engine Optimization reasons, and have no intention of changing it - so don't ask.

<div>
YOU SHOULD ALWAYS RENAME YOUR IMAGES IF POSSIBLE!  Several larger (and smaller) ISP's now implement their own transparent caches which ignore and/or do not relay the flush request to Zoovy.
