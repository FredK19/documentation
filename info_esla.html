[[TITLE]Enhanced Service Level Agreement]

[[SECTION]Concept Overview]
This document is offered to clients who have opted for our Enhanced Service Level agreement and who feel they need more protection than the standard Zoovy terms of service affords. This agreement is negotiated by each client on an individual basis typically as part of an annual contract.  It does not apply to all clients.
[[/SECTION]]

[[STAFF]]

This is available on a client by client basis, 
typically as part of a negotiated pricing agreement and an 
annual contract. 

This is only offered to clients when specifically requested. 

Generally this should only be discussed with clients who are 
willing to commit more than $20k in revenue (minimums, or 
setup fees) over the next calendar year.

That means if the client wants an "ESLA" then they're going to 
be expected to commit to certain revenue targets:
E.g. existing client - minimum monthly fee up to  $1,500/mo. minimum
E.g. new client - $12,000 setup, plus $650/mo. minimum

Clients doing less than $500/mo. in success fees should always work
within our normal TOS. I don't care if they want an ESLA, they can't 
have one without a larger budget.

[[SECTION]Uptime Agreement]

Zoovy shall provide clients with a commitment to have any service outages resolved within 4 hours.  If two or more subsequent events each exceeding 30 minutes occur within a 24 hour period, then they shall be treated as one event and count cumulatively.

[[BREAK]]

After the fourth hour, the client shall receive a credit equal to 5% of their previous monthly invoice for each hour of the outage including the initial four hours.

[[BREAK]]

This service level agreement does not include outages caused by acts of god, or outages stemming from issues with upstream bandwidth providers. 

[[BREAK]]

The time-frame for the notification shall be from the first notification and shall
end when the ability to create an order is restored.  At any point after an outage at the clients request Zoovy shall demonstrate the system availability by placing an order.

[[BREAK]]

The client is responsible for notifying Zoovy either by electronic ticket, or calling 877-966-8948 and informing the operator that it is an emergency and the client will provide reasonable assistance in diagnosing the issue, and agrees that all of Zoovys regular support protocols will be in place with regards to after hours escalation. 

[[BREAK]]

Outages shall be any situation where checkout for more than 50% of the items, or 50% of the clients arriving at the website is not possible.   Outages are caused by, but not limited to, hardware failures, facility failures, faulty software releases, or complete loss of connectivity issues. Within these constraints - Zoovy shall be the final arbiter for what determines an outage. 

[[/SECTION]]


[[SECTION]Termination Protection]

Zoovy shall endeavor to provide client an adequate period to migrate services, no less than 30 days, and no more than 90 days.  During this period Zoovy shall not be obligated to provide any support services aside from ensuring the system is available. Zoovy may (at it's sole discretion) lock the account so the client and it's staff may only access orders and not make any configuration changes which may require additional support resources.

[[BREAK]]



[[BREAK]]

In the event a termination for cause Zoovy shall be responsible for providing the client with copies of all data in either CSV, or XML format, along with reasonable documentation.
