<h1>Newsletter Manager</h1>
<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>





The Newsletter Manager is found under Utilities > Newsletter Manager. It requires the CRM bundle which can be added under Setup > Add/Remove Features.
<br>
The CRM Newsletter Manager allows you to easily format and send email to subscribers of your mailing list(s).
A single Zoovy store may have up to 16 different newsletter subscriber lists.
<br>

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
Customers will only be given an option to subscribe to your list(s) if they create a new account at checkout. The option to subscribe is given on the same page as password creation. This means that your Checkout Settings must be set at "Nice", "Strict" or "Default" and the customer must choose to create a new account. If the customer already has an account created, they will not have an option to change the subscription settings at checkout.

Merchants can create campaigns by selecting a subscriber list.

<h2>Unsolicited Commercial Email UCE/SPAM vs. Legitimate Commercial Email</h2>

Zoovy does not permit our customers to send Unsolicited Commercial Email ("UCE") commonly referred to as SPAM.
Zoovy has worked very hard to ensure that emails from our community of reputable businesses is always able to reach it's intended recipient. Therefore Zoovy must insist that any email, sent by any member meets the highest standards of legitimate commercial email. In this endeavor Zoovy has worked very hard to establish contractual agreements with most of the major ISP's which allow our mail to be delivered and NOT to be treated as junk mail - in exchange we have agreed that our members will abide by a strict code of conduct.<br>
<br>
The CAN-SPAM act of 2005 which is now Federal Law mandates that any email of a commercial nature include valid return headers and contact information for the company sending the email. Both AOL and MSN take this one step further by requiring that commercial email clearly identify the sending company (Zoovy) in addition to the company whose products are being advertised, and contain a valid mailing address, phone number and that the content of those message do not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of other companies.<br>
<br>
In addition many states have rules that are similar, or stricter than the CAN-SPAM act. In general all state legislature all require the email clearly identify the company who is sending the email, and provide a working opt-out link or some sort. It is the responsibility of the business sending the email to ensure that the message complies with the laws of the recipients state. If you believe you may have subscribers under the age of 18 you may have additional laws you need to comply with.<br>
<br>
As such any attempt to intentionally circumvent the policies Zoovy has set forth in terms of data formatting will result in immediate, irrevocable, and indefinite account suspension in addition to any legal remedies which may be provided by both state and federal law. In addition to account suspension Zoovy's terms of service state that in addition to account suspension we may, at our discretion go back to the business and obtain damages for any disruption caused by the intentional action of one of our subscribers. <br>
<Br>
In addition - any attempt to intentionally re-subscribe customers who have either intentionally, or un-intentionally opt-ed out of receiving the newsletter is considered a violation of the Zoovy terms of service, not to mention in direct conflict with the policy privacy established by you and Zoovy and posted on your website.  As such attempt to resubscribe a customer without explicit verbal or written consent from the newsletter subscriber would be considered a strict violation of both Zoovy policies and Federal Law, in addition to allowing the customer to possibly pursue legal remedies in a civil court.<br>
<br>
We're sorry if this seems a bit over the top. We take this stuff really seriously, if you plan on sending commercial email - you should too.

<h2>Newsletters: Getting Started</h2>

<section>
<h3>Subscription Lists</h3>
A subscription list is a mailing list that your customers can subscribe to.  You should take some time and think about this before creating these.  Each Zoovy store is currently limited to 16 subscriptions lists and, at this time, they can not be deleted.  You can rename the lists, however once you have people subscribed to the list, renaming it from one subject to another is NOT a good idea, as that is not what your customers already subscribed to.

<aside class="cbc">
<h6>Creating a New Subscription List</h6>
<div>
<li>Log in to your account at www.zoovy.com.</li>
<li>Click on the Utilities tab.</li>
<li>Click on the Newsletter Manager link.</li>
<li>Push the 'Setup New Subscription List' button.</li>
<li>Enter a name for your new list.  Names should be very short but descriptive.</li>
<li>Enter a short description for the list.  This should describe what the content of the mailer will include and how often it will be sent.</li>

</div>
</aside>

<li>Select a list type</li>
<li>Save your new list</li>
</section>

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>If you get a message saying that you must configure your domain for newsletters you will need to:
<li> Go to Setup > Domain Hosting > Domain Config
<li> Expand the domain that you will be sending emails from
<li> Enter a domain that you wish to send newsletters from. This should be a dedicated URL solely for sending otu newsletters.<br>
This should let you go onto the next step, setting up a subscription list.

</div>
</aside>


The behavior of the list is configurable with the following options: Opt-Out, Opt-In and Private; each setting has a description next to it so please select accordingly.  Once the newly created Subscription Lists has been saved, you can move on to create and configure your Campaigns.

</section>

<section>
<h3>Campaigns</h3>
Each newsletter you send is referred to as a campaign.  Once you are ready to send out your newsletter, you'll need to configure a campaign. Campaigns are primarily used to send notification to the specified customers that are included in  a Subscription List, however there is an option to send to "All Newsletter Subscribers". This would be more appropriate for the General Campaigns.

<aside class="cbc">
<h6>Configuring a Newsletter Campaign</h6>
<div>
<li>Click on the Utilities tab.</li>
<li>Click on the Newsletter Manager link.</li>
<li>Push the 'Setup New Campaign' button.</li>
<li>Name the Campaign.</li>
<li>Select the source email address.</li>
<li>Enter a subject.</li>
<li>Select a wholesale pricing schedule, if needed.</li>
<li>Select the Max Coupon Uses, if applicable.</li>
<li>Select which list of recipients this mailing should go to.</li>
<li>Push the Step 2 button (this saves the campaign and prompts you to build the newsletter itself).</li>

</div>
</aside>

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div> Despite the name, "Max Coupon Uses" has nothing to do with coupons. It refers to the number of times a wholesale schedule can be used when clicking through the newsletter. In effect, this behaves like a coupon. 
</div>
</aside>

<br>
<li> Name - label for what you are selecting for the name of this particular campaign.
<li> Source Email - email address that will be shown as the "From:" address of the newsletter. Newsletter Source Emails can be configured by going to Setup / Domain Hosting / Emails.
<li> Subject - subject line/title of your newsletter email.
<li> Wholesale Price Schedule - this setting adjusts prices for any products listed in the newsletter to reflect any wholesale pricing adjustments.  For example, if you are sending a newsletter to a group of your wholesale customers that are all on Schedule A (-10%), you could select that schedule here, and all product prices would reflect that -10% adjustment.
<li> Max Coupon Uses - This refers to the frequency the Schedule is applied to the email. ie if the Schedule is defined as "$5 off" with a Schedule Countdown of 4, only the first 4 orders purchased per email will receive $5 off.
<li> Recipients - allows you to select which subscription list will be receiving the newsletter email.
<br>

<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>
When configuring the Recipients portion, please carefully select from the list.  Consider, the purpose or use of the Campaign. Many customers in the past have selected a specific Subscription List for Recipients, which only included a handful of customers, when in actuality, the campaign was intended to notify ALL Subscribers. This happens often!

<h3>Building the newsletter (steps 2 - 4)</h3>

<b>Step 2: Choose a Page Layout -</b> When selecting a Newsletter Layout, Zoovy provide three standard layouts to choose from. To select a Newsletter, click the Select link to the right of the screen. This should Auto-generate a preview of how the layout should look.  Use the Edit link to edit messages and text.  Use the Products link to add/remove products to the layout.<br><br>

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
Use the following variables to automatically fill in the email, full name or first name of your email recipient. 
<br>%EMAIL%
<br>%FULLNAME%
<br>%FIRSTNAME%

</div>
</aside>




<b>Step 3 - </b> Once you have selected the Layout, you can add text, pictures and/or product using the builder.  The editable elements available depend on which layout you have selected.Preview/Send Test. This requires you to Add featured Products, and Configure/Edit text messages.

<br>

<b>Step 4: Preview/Send your Newsletter - </b>  This requires sending yourself a Test Newsletter. After selecting the layout and adding your products/messages, you will get a preview of the acutual Newsletter (NOTE: The Test Email you receive will show the %EMAIL% variable, and not an actual email address, since there is no actual subscriber email associated with the test email). Towards the bottom of the Screen, be sure to populate your email address in the "Test Recipient Email" heading.  After confirming that the Newsletter has been sent (via your email), and generated properly, the Test Email will contain a link titled "APPROVE". Once approved is clicked, the user will be directed back to the Zoovy Newsletter configurator to complete Newsletter Setup.<br><br>

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
If you receive the message "This campaign may have been changed since this Test email was sent. Please resend a test email and press the approval button from that email", you will need to resend a test email and approve the most recent test email that has been sent.  If you make any changes to the newsletter once it has been approved, you will have to approve it again.

</div>
</aside>


<b>Step 5: Approve and Send your Campaign - </b>Be sure to confirm the Campaign Name, as well as the Send Date (MM-DD-YYYY), and proceed by clicking the Approve button.<br><br>

<h2>Good Practices for Avoiding your Newsletter being Flagged as Spam</h2>
<section>
<h3>In the content of your mail</h3>
<li>Use conversational language</li>
<li>Avoid spam keywords in the subject line (FREE, click here, etc - google this for comprehensive lists)</li>
<li>Keep your email short.  too much html or text can get you identified as spam</li>
<li>Do NOT use excessive spacing and/or capitalization in your subject or content.</li>
<li>Do not use strange/cute spellings, Don't S.P.A.C.E out your words, don't use str@nge |etters or characters. </li>
<li>Don't use tools which generate horrendous HTML (example: MS Word). They often leave signs behind (like empty tags, eg: <B></B>) which are generally found in spam. Make sure your HTML is valid (run it through a decent validator). Unbalanced tags and invalid tags will also flag an email as spam.</li>
<li>If you use a title, make sure the title is meaningful.</li>
<li>If you're using HTML emails, do not use invisible text within those emails. Make sure your text colors and sizes are distinct enough and large enough to read.</li>
<li>Make sure your privacy policy (including enforcement and contact information) is easily found and clearly stated in your store. It's good to include this information in your emails. - <i>Zoovy does this for you in the footer</i></li>
<br>
</section>

<section>
<h3>As a Business</h3>
<li>Be careful where you advertise, and be careful which advertisements you carry. If you advertise with companies that send out spam, your domains will be flagged as being related to spam. If you carry advertisements for those who spam, your domains will be flagged as being related to spam. </li>
<li>Be careful which domains/companies you allow to advertise in your emails (if any). Allowing spammers to advertise will get your emails flagged by the URI blacklists. On the other hand, don't advertise your domains with spammers -- having your domain name listed in their spams can also get you flagged by some URI blacklists. </li>
