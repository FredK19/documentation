EFFECTIVE  1/1/05 -- THIS FEATURE IS DEPRECATED AND IS NO LONGER SUPPORTED.<br>
<br>

<br>
Support will be provided for EXISTING installations only, 
no support will be provided on new installations - 
in addition no feature requests will be implemented. <br>
<br>
Customers who ship via FedEx and are looking for the best integration should visit:<br>

Order Manager.<br>
<br>
This documentation/instructions is designed for FedEx Cafe Builds 2180.
Newer builds of Cafe are dramatically different and are not compatible.
Please do not contact FedEx for integration support on Cafe builds newer
than 2180 (pretty much any version received after Nov 2004.)

<hr>
<b>DEPRECATED FEATURE:</b><br>

The FedEx ShipManager Cafe client software is available by contacting your FedEx account manager.
At this time the Cafe software is only available to customers who have a daily pickup arrangement with FedEx,
however FedEx has announced its intentions to release a version of ShipManager Cafe for customers who do not have Daily Pickup accounts.
If you use a drop off location we encourage you to contact FedEx to see if you are eligible to receive a copy of ShipManager Cafe.<br>
<br>
<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>

Zoovy has verified compatibility with FedEx ShipManager build 2180 and later.
This feature requires Order Manager build 4.39 beta 2 which can be downloaded from: http://support.zoovy.com/beta

<h2>Setup</h2>


<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>

This document is intended for use by a FedEx Customer Integration Consultant (CIC).
While you may be able to configure this without the assistance of a FedEx CIC - Zoovy does not recommend this.

Zoovy Order Manager creates CTS export files formatted for use with the FedEx Passport feature of Ship Manager Cafe.

<b>The FedEx "Secret" Daily Password</b><br>
ShipManager Cafe does not have the required Passport functionality by default.
So as part of the installation you must enable Passport in your ShipManager Cafe software.
Since FedEx considers this configuration of Passport to be too technical for your average user, you're going to need the secret "Daily" password.
Fortunately, the password isn't that secret - in fact it can be easily obtained by calling FedEx ShipManager Automation Support,
who will give you a password that is good for one day.<br>
<br>
First call 1-800-GO-FEDEX and say "FedEx ShipManager Automation Support" at the first menu prompt when digital-attendant asks what service you'd like.
Then select 1 for Ship Manager Support, then select 1 again for Installation Issues.
Simply tell the friendly FedEx representative you wish to enable the Passport functionality and you need the password.
The representative will likely ask you for your system id, this is NOT your FedEx account number -
it is the meter number which is in the menu bar of your Cafe software (hint: it is a six digit number adjacent to the version number of the software).
If in doubt, the FedEx Tech can probably help you find it.
Once you have the password, then you may proceed with the steps below.
PLEASE NOTE - FEDEX PASSWORDS ARE ALWAYS IN UPPER CASE, if you type the password in lower case it won't work!
(we mention it here only because FedEx techs love to forget to mention this little detail)<br>
<br>
On a final note: Please don't call Zoovy and ask what the ShipManager password is, we don't know - it changes every day, and we don't have it.

First we need to do is configure Order Manager to create Passport files.

<aside class="cbc">
<h6>'Configuring Order Manager to export FedEx Passport files'</h6>
<div>
<li> Load the Zoovy Order Manager
<li> Go to Tools | FedEx ShipManager Setup
<li> Verify that your FedEx account # appears in the screen, if it does not then enter it.
<li> Meter number can be left blank (it is not currently used)
<li> Select the Default Service - this is the FedEx service which will be most commonly used. (NOTE: Zoovy will automatically flip between
Home Delivery and FedEx ground for residential / non-residential addresses)
<li> Select the Default Package Type - typically this will be customer packaging.
<li> Specify the FedEx Passport File, we recommend you set this to C:\zoovy-passport.in (note: you must end the file with a .in extension)
<li> Click the okay button to save.

</div>
</aside>


Then all we do is configure the PassPort functionality in the FedEx Ship Manager Cafe software.
(If you are doing this without a CIC and didn't read the hint above about the FedEx Daily Password, we recommend you stop here and go back and read it!)

<aside class="cbc">
<h6>'Enabling Passport in FedEx Ship Manager'</h6>
<div>
<li> Select Customize from the menu along the top
<li> Select System Settings
<li> Highlight your system profile
<li> Click the modify button
<li> Select tab #4 "FedEx Express Admin"
<li> At this point you will be prompted for the daily password - instructions for getting the password are above. (this password changes every day, or we'd give it to you here)
<li> At this point you should enable the three checkboxes for Passport System. Specifically "Batch", "Auto Listening", and "Label Transfer"
<li> PLEASE - [NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU THINK IT WILL HELP] - DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES TO YOUR SHIP MANAGER SOFTWARE WITHOUT CONSULTING A FEDEX CIC FIRST!
<li> Now cross your fingers and click the okay button to save.

<h2>Usage</h2>

Getting setup is a bit tricky, fortunately using the Passport integration on a day to day basis isn't. Just follow the simple steps below.
<aside class="cbc">
<h6>'Shipping with FedEx Ship Manager'</h6>
<div>
<li> In Order Manager select one or more orders and then right click and select Export to FedEx Ship Manager.
<li> The C:\zoovy-passport.in file will be automatically overwritten with the new data.
<li> Load the FedEx Ship Manager window (if you already have it open, thats fine too)
<li> Click on "Passport" in the menu area.
<li> We recommend you enable the "Batch Edit" in the processing mode area (this will let you verify the weight, and shipping type of each package)
<li> Set the input file to C:\zoovy-passport.in
<li> Set the export file to C:\passport-export.in
<li> NOTE: While doing a test run you may want to click the Test Mode, this will prevent any real airbills from being printed.
<li> Click the "Start Input" button to start reading from the input file
<li> Each airbill will be displayed, you will probably want to verify the weight of each package as well as the service type.
<li> NOTE: If you are using FedEx Ground as your default service type then the system will automatically check the residential box and select
FedEx home delivery for any order which does not contain a company name in the ship to field.

<h2>Mapping Fields</h2>


Fields that you can mapped to for reports/email include:<br><br>
<li>Field 1204 - Ship Alert Email ID 1 - max length 35
<li>Field 3002 - Ground Invoice Number (35) - order number
<li>Field 25 - Express Reference Info (35) - order number

</article>
<article>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

At this time we are aware that this integration does not support International Addresses.
This is probably fine, we don't think any of our customers ship internationally with FedEx, if you plan to - please let us know and we'll add it.<br>
<br>
If you receive a parsing error please make a note of the error and
open a Zoovy support ticket and MAKE SURE you attach the zoovy-passport.in file to the ticket.
Please also include the version # of the Cafe software and if there was more than one transaction see if you can identify which order # it occurred on.
(HINT: the zoovy-passport.in file gets overwritten each time you export a new order, so don't wait until your done processing orders.)<br>
<br>

If you receive a "Runtime Error 76" exporting to Fedex Ship Manager, please check your configuration to make sure your mapping is correct.  If you
are mapping to a network drive, make sure the drive is mounted. <br><br>

This is currently an experimental feature, you're welcome to use it, and we think it works great -
but please be aware that any fixes will likely require a new release of the Order Manager client and could take a week [or longer] to implement.
We are actively seeking comments on how we can enhance this feature.
