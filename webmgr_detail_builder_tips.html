<h2>Linking in the page content and between specialty stores</h2>

When creating links in your content, you should use wiki as much as possible.  This is a sure-fire way to make sure the links are created correctly and are handled properly for things like syndication.

When adding links within a banner element, you should be very careful how you set these up, especially if you have specialty stores and are bouncing your customers between them.  The link should be set up as follows:  
<br>
linking within your store: %SESSION%/category/category.safe.name - Notice the absence of a domain name. It isn't needed.
<br>
linking to a specialty store: http://www.mynewdomain.com%CART%/ or http://www.mynewdomain.com%CART%/product/productid
<br>

The %CART% will output a slash before the variable, but not after, so be sure to put a slash at the end. If you don't use the %CART% variable when linking between specialty stores, then the 'cart' will not travel with the customer.

<h3>Why are links so picky?</h3>
If a customer comes into your store from a search engine and arrives at USERNAME.zoovy.com, adds a item to their cart, then follows a link that you set up to YOURDOMAIN.com, the cart will appear to empty. Browsers can not read cookies across domains.	That's a limitation of the browser, not Zoovy. So customers who switch from yourdomain.com to yourotherdomain.com will lose their cart.  To solve this, set up links as described above.
</section>

<p>Linking using the %SESSION% variable is important.  It will substitute out for the domain the customers are on and will also pass along the session id which is used as part of the cart. NOTE - links generated by the system, such as in product lists, categories, and the menus will always use the proper syntax.</p>

<b>Linking between specialty stores:</b>
Prior to testing this technology, you should clear your cookies and your cache because it is possible you already have a cart 'built' on one of your specialty stores, which would make it appear as though this technology isn't working properly.  For example, on Tuesday you visit your store YourXDomain.com and add something to your cart but don't purchase it.  You close the browser and move on.  On Thursday you visit your store YourYDomain.com and add an item to your cart.  You then click the link to go from YourYDomain.com to YourXDomain.com.  Since you already have a cart at YourXDomain.com left from Tuesday, that is the cart you will see, instead of the YourYDomain.com cart from Thursday.  It is not possible to merge the carts, and this way the data from both carts is preserved. 
<br>

The likelihood of this affecting your customers is quite slim.  The likelihood of this affecting you/your employees is a bit higher.

<h2>Linkable Image Elements</h2>
Some themes and page layouts contain image elements that have an associated text box where a destination url can be entered.  In this case, do NOT use WIKI.  Just place the proper destination using the Zoovy variables.  For example, to link to a category page, you would enter %SESSION%/category/category.safe.name into the textbox.  No href or html is necessary.
