<h2>Solution #1</h2>

Due to the fact that you are doing a 301 redirect on your koie.zoovy.com domain which is permanent. Your mail will no longer function for that domain. This is due to the fact of when your redirecting a domain you are telling everyone this domain is no longer valid. Therefore your domain will not be able to receive mail. If you have further questions or concerns please let us know by reopening this ticket.

<h2>Problem #2</h2>
This does not address the problem.  Our customer is sending the emails to user@mydomain.com.  Please see email thread below and update status.  Thanks.

Our email server administrator advises us the email was rejected by your email server.  
So you need to have your email server administrator to investigate.  Below email message indicates the reason for rejection.

<h2>Solution #2</h2>

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
The sub-user on the zoovy side doesn't have email enabled.

</div>

This problem seems pretty obvious (unless I'm missing something) - the user you are trying to access is not a valid alias for admin@username.zoovy.com and does not have a separate mailbox.

<br>

There are two ways this can be corrected:

<br>

<ol>
<li> You can create an alias for user@yourdomain.com in the admin@username.zoovy.com -- OR --
<li> You can login to the zoovy site as the administrator, go to setup / user logins
delete the user, and then re-add this account with email. 
This will create a separate email mailbox for subuser@username.zoovy.com along with aliases for all your domains.

If you need assistance you can contact us by phone on Monday, or if you'd like me to do it - I'd be happy to, just let me know which route you'd like to take.
