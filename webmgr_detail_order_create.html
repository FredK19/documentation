<h2>Create New Order without Incomplete Item</h2>

To create an order without creating an incomplete item, simply select the create order button directly instead of the create new option and fill in the requested information.<br><br>

Please note: At this time you can only have one unique item per line item per invoice.  So you cannot have 2 unique line items with the same product SKU.

<h2>Smart Address Feature</h2>


You will notice that address is a single box, rather than having separate boxes for street, city, state, zip, etc.
The Smart Address feature intelligently parses an address and does not make you separate fields such as city, state and zip.
This is extremely clever feature since it allows you to cut and paste addresses which are often sent in email or
other electronic format for quickly creating orders. In the event that a smart address cannot be intrepreted you will need
to correct the fields once you get into order edit.
