<h2>Concept Overview</h2>



Kount is the most advanced fraud screen product available to e-commerce merchants, and is  pre-integrated into the zoovy platform.  In order to sign up, please go to the Analytics & Plugins area of your Zoovy account, and click Kount.  Alternatively, you may create a support ticket if you would like assistance with getting this setup.

<h2>Kount vs. other solutions - why it's better</h2>
Simply put: Kount was not designed as a bolt-on.  Most fraud products integrate into a payment gateway, these products offer what fraud experts call "warm fuzzy blanket" protection (it makes you feel safe, but isn't really effective). 
Kount is very different because it is highly effective.  Most gateways receive a very limited amount of information on a transaction which they then relay to a fraud screen. This information includes data like buyer name, credit card, and MAYBE a line item description and amount of each item being purchased -- we know this because they ONLY GET what Zoovy sends them.
That is why those fraud screen products can't identify fraud with such limited information - you're basically asking a blind person looking out a window "what's the weather like?" and trusting their answer.
Kount integrates with the site, it tracks buyers and builds heuristic profiles, it has data like "the fencible value" of a good being purchased. It literally takes into account hundreds of facets of data to create an actionable score.  That is - in a nutshell why Kount has the potential to be so much more effective.

<h2>How much does it cost?</h2>
There is a $0.25 per transaction fee, and if you choose to use their Targus option, it is $0.25 in addition.  There may be additional fees for certain types of reports (identity research) which are to be determined.   There are no integration or monthly fees for Zoovy clients.

<h2>Compatibility Concerns</h2>

Requirements - need to have a wrapper that is compatible with the sidebar functionality so that the Kaptcha will work.
Tips:
<li> Rules are applied "AND" not "OR" so US Ship and US Bill, conditions within a rule can be applied either AND or OR.
<li> Customer creation date - having a rule for customers after 1 year.
WHY NOT: if a merchant has a policy. 
<li> Approve rules use sparingly.
