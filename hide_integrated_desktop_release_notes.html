<h1>Integrated Desktop Client v7 Release Notes</h1>

<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>

The Zoovy Integrated Desktop (ZID) is the new name for the combined Order Manager and Warehouse Manager products.  This document tracks the changes in each new version as well as any known critical issues in a current or recent release. 

<br>

The 7.056 will be the last release in the ZID 7.0 series. Version 8.0 will be released in Q1 with a new database (non-Access). 

<br>


<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
Releases ending in an odd number e.g. 7.005 are considered BETA or "less stable", whereas releases ending in an even number e.g. 7.006 would be considered RELEASE-CANDIDATES or "more stable". The entire 7.xxx series is a development branch which means it's releases will undergo less testing in an effort to get features into the application at a faster pace. 

</div>
</aside>


<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>
Integrated Desktop Clients can be installed concurrently with Order Manager, and Warehouse Manager however companies should avoid processing orders or managing products concurrently due to the potential for data corruption issues. 

<br>

PLEASE DO NOT PROCESS CONCURRENTLY: The risk of data corruption when concurrently processing is VERY REAL. Users which are found to be concurrently processing may be charged for additional support time, lose BPP eligibility, and may have either version 6 or 7 locked out of their account. We take this very seriously, we don't like doing unnecessary data recoveries. 

<br>

Our implementation team is always ready to assist you with your conversion questions. Please schedule an appointment with someone if you are at all uncomfortable with upgrading alone. 

</div>
</aside>


<br>

Discussion of specific enhancements which are intended to be incorporated into the 7.xxx series are available to BPP Clients who have executed a non-disclosure agreement during their quarterly reviews.
