<h2>About this Tool</h2>

The eBay Auction (New Format) channel is designed to list a single listing on eBay, and at your discretion re-list it one time if it
does not sell. In order to participate you will need to have an eBay ID which you can get by going to <a href="http://www.ebay.com">www.ebay.com</a>,
and you will also need to register to sell.<br>

<h2>Operational Details</h2>

This channel will typically go from pending to active within 30 minutes of being created. Once it has been picked up by the
eBay system it will say it is "Loaded into the Todo Queue" which basically means that it is waiting for something before it can
launch (such as a window of time). Auctions launch within the timeframe allocated for them.<br>
<br>
Revoking this channel will cause Zoovy to stop tracking the auction. It will NOT remove the auction from eBay.<br>
Removing the channel will cause Zoovy to close the auction immediately, the highest bidder will be selected and processed - if your
auction has bids, you should remove them using eBay.com first.<br>
<br>
A the end of this channel, it will be moved to completed and an External Item will be created. External Items appear in the
"Incomplete" section of the order manager (both Windows and Web versions). For more information on external items and claims
please review the documentation in the help area.<br>

<h2>Special Notes</h2>

Under normal circumstances eBay will notify Zoovy when a listing is completed via Buy it Now, this notification occurs at the
same time the eBay End of Auction Winner email is sent. However this notification is "unreliable" meaning that if the eBay system
becomes too busy it may discard the notifications. In these circumstances, Zoovy has a backup system which polls all listings
every 24 hours, and if any missed listings are found, then the interval is decreased to four hours for the next few days.

You can shorten the polling interval to 6 hours by creating an eBay gallery channel.
In the event that an Incomplete item is not created, you should send a buyer to the instant checkout link:<br><br>
http://ebayapi.zoovy.net/checkout.cgi<br><br>

Or click the instant checkout button in your listing, this will attempt to close the
listing immediately.

If you notice that none of your listings are being closed, and more than 24 hours has elapsed please notify Zoovy immediately
and we will make eBay engineering aware of the problem. Be sure to include a relevant eBay ID which has been closed for more than
24 hours.
<br>
This channel is NOT compatible with eBay motors, or eBay stores categories [they have their own channels]<br>
