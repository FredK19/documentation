<h1>Promotion API</h1>
<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>

A promotion API is a CGI (e.g. Perl/PHP) program which computes custom shipping.
Shipping APIs are passed an XML representation of the current cart which then
based on a companies internal business logic perform operations on the cart.
The promotion API then output headers and data in a XML format.
A promotion API may return one or more shipping methods, along with a price for each method.

<h2>Custom Attributes</h2>
Promotion API's may be passed a list of attributes for each product in the cart, this may include custom attributes
specified by the site owner. This is to increase performance by avoiding having to do additional lookups of product data.

<h2>POST Format</h2>
What Zoovy sends to your URL:

<aside class="html">
<h6></h6>
<code>

&lt;?xml version="1.0"&gt;<br>
&lt;PROMOTIONAPI_REQUEST&gt;<br>
&lt;cart&gt;<br>
&lt;product id="xx" qty="##" price="#.##" wt="###" tax="Y|N"&gt;description&lt;/product&gt;<br>
&lt;product id="xx" qty="##" price="#.##" wt="###" tax="Y|N"&gt;description&lt;/product&gt;<br>
&lt;/cart&gt;<br>
&lt;attribs&gt;<br>
   &lt;product id="xx" owner_tag1="x" owner_tag2="" /&gt;<br>
   &lt;product id="xx" owner_tag1="x" owner_tag2="" /&gt;<br>
&lt;/attribs&gt;<br>
&lt;/PROMOTIONAPI_REQUEST&gt;<br>

</code>
</aside>


<br>
Notes:<br>
In &lt;attribs&gt; the id= tag represents products, whereas in the &lt;cart&gt; the id= represents a full sku with options.<br>
The values of owner_tag1 derive from whatever is placed in the Promotion API attribute list, for
example zoovy:prod_name, zoovy:base_cost would translate to zoovy_prod_name and zoovy_base_cost respectively.
Remember that owner names are not allowed to have underscores, so if you need to seperate the owner and tag names,
simply replace the first underscore (from left to right) with a colon (:) to get the actual tag name in ZML notation.
This translation is intended to provide compatibility with more XML parsers.<br>
