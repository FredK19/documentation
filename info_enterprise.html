<h1>Integrated Desktop Enterprise Edition</h1>

<article>
<h2>Concept Overview</h2>

The Enterprise platform provides multi-user functionality compared to the SOHO (Small Office/Home Office) which is only intended for use on a single computer.

In an Enterprise configuration the warehouse manager database is shared with the order manager database. Having a shared database means that products, or inventory updates that are added via warehouse manager are instantly seen by the Order Manager desktop client regardless if the database has been synchronized or not.

<h2>Flavors</h2>
Enterprise customers in two flavors:
<ul>
<li> Basic - $195/mo. this is what most customers will need. 
<li> Plus - $500/mo.  this is the same code base, but comes with an enhanced level of developer support, specifically intended for clients who are developing their own stand-alone applications which will WRITE data into the database. 
</ul>

Enterprise monthly fees are applied to the monthly minimum, so most clients doing sufficient sales volume to necessitate Enterprise will not see any additional fees.

<h2>Getting Enterprise</h2>

<!--
Currently Enterprise is in a pilot phase - even though it shouldn't be.
Currently Enterprise does not check access flags.
There is no need for an Enterprise flag or billing package in order to use Enterprise.

We will need to make sure all clients have an Enterprise bundle before we enable the flags, and we will need to do another release of Enterprise.

-->


The current process for bringing customers onto the Enterprise platform:
<ul>
<li> Forward customer to Enterprise Program Manager (EPM)
<li> EPM contacts client, explains the program, expectations, upgrade procedures, etc. 
<li> Customer purchases dell server specified by Zoovy and has it shipped DIRECTLY to them.
<li> Customer applies windows patches and updates. 
<li> Customer brings server online, EPM or Operations sets an appointment to provision server remotely. 
<li> Server downloads data from Zoovy.
<li> Customer coordinates with EPM to "go live" on Enterprise and discontinue use of SOHO or SOHONET
</ul>

We encourage servers to buy the Dell server via Zoovy's reseller account, this allows us to contact Dell on the merchants behalf - Zoovy does not mark up the servers at all.

<br>

Customers who wish to use their own server pay a $1,000 provisioning fee. There is no provisioning fee for clients who purchase a new server which is dedicated to Enterprise.
