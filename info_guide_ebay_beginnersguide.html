<h1>General Info / eBay Selling Techniques</h1>
<article>
<h2>eBay Selling Techniques</h2>
eBay is the largest auction site in the world. By putting your products on eBay
you can expose them to new customers who are interested in purchasing your products
online. Zoovy can facilitate the creation of an Ebay auction by either placing
the auction for you, or letting you create the auction using any software or the
eBay interface and then importing the auction into the Zoovy system. When an auction
being tracked by the Zoovy system is complete all the high bidders will be automatically contacted by Zoovy and invited to come back to your store and purchase the item. Zoovy will create an "external item" which includes the price, name, weight, and description of the auction and will allow the auction winner(s) to purchase that item. Winners can combine multiple auctions from any auction site, and Zoovy will apply your standard shipping and payment policies to the order. The best part is the person can purchase any other item from your store and combine them into one order. By having people complete auctions through your store you familiarize them with your business, and increasing the likelihood they will return directly in the future to purchase additional items. In addition you get the additional short term bonus of having an order placed through your
store! If you're new to eBay I would like to take a second and welcome you! eBay
is an interesting place, it has its own language, manners, and more. It is a community
built around commerce, and in most cases is the definitive guide to the "market
price" of any item. But most importantly eBay is a community, and like any new
arrival to a community, you will need to work hard to establish your reputation
as a trustworthy and honest merchant.

<h2>Newcomers</h2>

A lot of people expect to just throw their items up on eBay and start instantly
making money, and while this is true for certain items, as a new merchant it means
that you have no reputation and that any buyer who considers purchasing from you
may not be willing to take the risk, therefore your success in the short run may
be limited. Be prepared - Typically the first hundred transactions will generally
suffer from low bid prices and less activity than if you had an active account.
The fact of the matter is you're a little late hopping on the eBay bandwagon, but
there's still plenty of room and you'll have to do a little running to catch up!

<h2>NOTE:</h2>

This document assumes little or no experience with eBay. It is designed for new
sellers selling single item auctions of commodity products using either Zoovy
Auction Wizard, and eventually Zoovy Power Lister. In other words we're going
to try to KISS - Keep It Simple Stupid. If you plan on using Dutch or One of Kind
auctions please ignore the strategy section of this document and use the resources
in this document to gain additional insight.

<h2>Auction Assistance Resources</h2>

Before getting started lets talk about what sort of help is available to you as
a Zoovy customer.
</article>
<article>
<h2>Purchase Training / Ask an Expert</h2>

If you have a Fast Track training or consulting package - schedule an appointment
to have one of the Marketplace Experts contact you. Marketplace Experts are people
who have made a living selling on the Marketplace before - in other words they
know what they are doing. Often a few minutes with a Marketplace Expert can save
weeks of independent testing! Sage advice, take it to heart. No matter how advanced
you are, in most all cases our experts can throw in tips and tricks that will
increase your bottom line. In many cases training pays for itself in as little
as a few days! Our experts have the backline numbers, rules and procedures, and
selling strategies down - after all, we deal with hundreds of sellers on a daily
basis.

<h2>eBay for Dummies</h2>

If you don't want to purchase training from Zoovy, you should consider picking up
a copy of an eBay book like eBay for Dummies. There's a lot to learn as far as
selling strategies, hot times, terminology, etiquette, and procedures in order
to really understand what you're doing - well beyond the scope of this document.
The "for Dummies" line has built a reputation for providing simple, no-nonsense
answers and information - we're very pleased they have an eBay book. It also demonstrates
how complicated a topic eBay can be. After all anything which deserves a 250+
page book - has got to be a little complicated.

<h2>Try Zoovy Forums</h2>
Zoovy Forums are no longer available.
</article>
<article>
<h2>Stay the Course</h2>

No matter what happens just remember many of the problems and frustrations you
have will disappear over time. eBay severely limits new users until you establish
a "feedback rating" - the system is designed to reward experienced sellers and
make it harder for newer -possibly fraudulent- sellers. This system is very necessary
to protect the consumer. Protecting the consumer is one of the primary reasons
eBay is very successful and such a phenomenal marketplace once you're up and running.
</article>
<article>
<h2>Common Errors</h2>

There are several common errors you might see as a new seller using Zoovy tools,
they are:<br>
eBay says you cannot process Dutch Auctions yet!<br>
A Dutch Auction means an Auction with a quantity of 2 or more. If you are a new seller you will not be able to use Dutch auctions until you have 50 successful transactions - called Feedbacks - associated with your account. To avoid this problem please set all auction quantities to 1.
<br>
Feedback too low to use Buy it Now! Need 10+ <br>
Buy it now is a feature which allows customers to purchase instantly on eBay. eBay requires that you perform 10 successful non-Buy it now transactions before being able to use this feature. Again, this requirement is in place to protect the consumer, so please respect it - and remember that anybody who sells on eBay has had to go through the same hassle. Once you have a feedback of 10, you should plan on using Buy It Now with every auction. Set your buy it now price at, or close to the MSRP of an item.

<h2>Understanding Strategy</h2>

Anytime you want to obtain top dollar for the items you're selling you need to understand the marketplace you are selling on.
With eBay the time you launch the Auction determines the time the Auction will close. Accordingly if you launch two auctions together, they will close at the same time. Most of eBay's traffic is online between 3:00pm to 9:00pm PST or 6:00pm - 12:00pm EST.  This is considered "Prime Time" for auctions and when the most bids come in. Sunday and Saturday seem to be preferred days, with an emphasis on Sunday. Most experienced sellers agree that Sunday at 6:00pm is the hottest time, but Your Mileage May Vary. You should keep an eye on the categories you are selling in to see when the hot bidding times are for the items you sell.  This is called your "optimal window".  For most sellers this will start almost instantly around 6:00pm PST and go until around 8:00pm. There are very advanced sellers who literally know their optimal windows down to the minute for each item they sell - it's a little spooky!
<br>
Some sellers believe that being in the middle of the listings isn't good.  When there are a lot of listings closing around the same time it's a buyers market. Try to keep your listings closing a little before or a little after the optimal window. Encourage those opportunistic bidders to bid on yours first, or to wait until most of the similar listings are over and the losing bidders are just frustrated and "ready to buy no matter what the cost".
<br>
Of course, waiting until the end assumes there will be a lot of losing bidders who want to drive the price up, and who aren't willing to wait until next week to go through the whole drill again to save a few dollars. If you wait until the end and you're right -eg: lots of frustrated bidders who have lost other auctions - ready to buy no matter what the cost- then you're going to make a killing. If you're wrong then you're going to get slammed. It's a game, no matter what you do, you will win some and lose some. Just like any game the more you play, the more you win, and the less you lose.

<h2>Buyer Strategy</h2>

eBay really is a Game - the more informed you are, the better you'll do. You need to keep an eye on the competition, see when other sellers are closing their auctions, and try to out smart them. Try to avoid having your listings grouped too closely to other listings. Remember buyers are always coming to the marketplace, placing bids and leaving.
Each item has it's own strategy, some items have more than one strategy - in fact most successful sellers use combinations of different strategies to maximize profits and grab as many possible buyers at the highest possible prices.
</article>
<article>
<h2>Strategy #1</h2>

Fact: eBay has a lot of bargain hunters on it.<br>
Assumption: eBay shoppers tend to be opportunistic bargain hounds they will generally only increase their maximum bidding price after unsuccessfully attempting to purchase an item several times -eg: being consistently outbid-.<br>
Assumption: As new buyers arrive they often bid on the closest ending item for an item which meets their needs and has a comfortable price zone. Buyer comfortable price zone takes into account feedback rating, shipping costs, etc.<br>
Assumption: eBay shoppers feel validation of their bargain hunting skill only by purchasing.<br>
Conclusion: Buyers will bid on the nearest -eg: soonest- closing item which meets
their needs. By waiting until the end of an optimal closing window, as time progresses
the more auctions bargain shoppers lose, they tend to raise their comfortable
bidding amount as fear sets in that they will never win.
</article>
<article>
<h2>Strategy #2</h2>

Fact: eBay is the worlds largest marketplace, you can buy anything. <br>
Assumption: eBay makes it easy to find and compare deals on similar items at the same time.<br>
Assumption: bidders don't like to do homework, they like to have all the items available to them at the same time, they will look at every thing and choose which one they will buy.<br>
Conclusion: Pretty pictures, good descriptions, easy shipping terms and immaculate feedback are important to ensure a hassle free transaction and win a buyers confidence.<br>
Conclusion: Having items online during primetime bidding makes it easier for customers
to find and purchase products. Price isn't really the issue, convenience and a
hassle free transaction are.<br>

<h2>Both Strategies Work</h2>

What is really interesting is both strategies work - EXTREMELY WELL! Both strategies
will generate sales. Both strategies can be used to build a successful business.
But now for the curve ball - using strategy #1 - attempting to sell to the bargain
hunters - will result in almost quadruple complaints, and negatives that strategy
#2 will. Why? Well it is my opinion that Strategy #1 tends to attract bargain
hunters, skeptics, and other "Type A" personalities who because of their frugal
nature - they tend to be very intolerant of any mistakes or issues which may arise
during the transaction. Also, because they often purchase towards the end of a
bidding frenzy, they often feel they overpaid and have buyers remorse.
</article>
<article>
<h2>Closing Window</h2>

If you have items listed too close together their closing windows will conflict
which will result in lower bids. The only time this doesn't apply is with things
like Pokemon cards when there is virtually ALWAYS something closing and the market
is so hot that it doesn't matter what your window is - it will sell. If you don't
understand this yet, don't worry because its sort of like Chess - you have to think three
moves ahead.
</article>
<article>
<h2>Duration</h2>

For beginners the duration should always be 7 days. This is the most common duration
and gives your item the most exposure without additional fees. 10 day auctions
have additional fees from eBay. Don't move this down unless you see your items
consistently reaching acceptable bid prices in shorter periods of time. Most items
sell best on a 7 day schedule. With eBay the time you launch the Auction determines
the time the Auction will close. Accordingly if you launch two auctions together,
they will close at the same time thus dividing the bidders and resulting in lower
final prices.
</article>
<article>
<h2>Using the Gallery</h2>

Zoovy has placed a gallery picture in the auction for you, which is the same as
your listing picture. Using the gallery results in an extra charge from eBay.
But definitely helps your item sell, the gallery is displayed after a search.
</article>
<article>
<h2>Avoid Upgrades</h2>

Additional features such as "feature in category", "bold print", "highlighted",
"gift icon", etc. all have additional fees. In many cases the fees could easily
exceed the selling price for your item. You should avoid upgrades unless you are
doing dutch auctions, which have a completely different strategy than the one
discussed in this document.
</article>
<article>
<h2>Avoiding Deadbeat Bidders</h2>

Deadbeat bidders are people who agree to buy an auction, but never follow through and pay. The most common cause of deadbeat bidders is that buyers will often violate eBay rules and place bids on multiple items, to see which one closes with the best price. This is a clear violation of the rules but eBay is a very poor policeman, so you just deal with it. However there are a few things you can do to avoid this, such as placing your auctions to end towards the end of the hot bidding time. Often deadbeat bidders will place very high bids on the first 3 or 4 items they see. Remember they are going to buy the cheapest
one, so who cares what they bid. In a lot of cases if you try to make them pay
they'll accuse you of shill bidding. Using another account to drive the price
of an auction up - which is the only excuse for not promptly paying for an item.
In many circumstances they will end up giving you a negative - which will hurt
you as a seller a lot more than it will hurt them as a buyer. The bottom line
is these people are deadbeats, so be smart and avoid them, let them bid on somebody
else's items!

<h2>Relist One Time Feature</h2>

Per eBay rules Zoovy can relist your auctions one time, if the auction sells then
the fees will be refunded. To enable this check the box which says "Relist One
Time" or "Enable Fee Reclamation" or "Enable Fee Credits" (depending on the version
the eBay channel you are using).<br>
<br>
Please note there are specific limitations when using this feature in conjunction
with channel scheduler. For this reason it is highly recommended that customers
read the documentation for Channel Scheduler before using these two features together.<br>
<br>
You should also look into the eBay Recycling bin, which is enabled by default for all listings which do not have the relist one time feature enabled.<br>

</article>
<article>
<h2>Relist without Relist One Time</h2>

If you did not launch the item through Zoovy, and or did not have the relist one time option enabled then there is no way to relaunch the item automatically.
You should manually relist the item, and then use the eBay item import channel to enable tracking on the new item number so Zoovy will automatically close it.
If you just want something to automatically relist until it sells you should probably
take a look at the eBay Power Lister channel.
