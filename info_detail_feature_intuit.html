<br>
Quickbooks is the #1 small business accounting application. <br>
<br>
Zoovy is the only eBay Certified Developer who is also a Quickbooks premier partner. Zoovy was featured as a key application in the Intuit 2003 Developer conference. 
<br>
<br>
Zoovy offers full synchronization support for invoices, sales receipts, customers, inventory and products with Intuit Quickbooks. Simply load the Zoovy Order Manager and click "Synchronize". Zoovy will do the rest, including creating products and customers in your Quickbooks database.
<Br>
<br>
Zoovy uses the Quickbooks COM interface for versions 2002, 2003, and 2004, so there is no risk of data corruption (unlike a variety of other programs which use the non-supported and risky IIF method).
