<h2>Issue #109822: Converting Timestamps</h2>

I'm trying to play around with our data. (In a duplicate of our database, not the live one.) I need to sort stuff into months, but I don't know how to convert your timestamp and created numbers into a date. I know I can go by the invoice number, but many times an invoice won't actually be paid for in the same month it was originally created.

<h2>Resolution</h2>

Converting the Epoch time in Microsoft access can be very difficult.

<br>
You might find it easier with Enterprise - because MySQL has a "from_unixtime" function which can be run against the database.
