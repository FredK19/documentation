<h2>Synchronization</h2>
When you first sync, you will see your Media Library folders in Warehouse Manager. The folders will include placeholders for each image but the image will appear as a question mark. In order to download the image locally, you must select the image. <br>
If you wish to upload several images to your Media Library, you can create a new folder in your Media Library by right clicking on the root folder you would like to create the new one within, and clicking on New Folder.  You can add any number of images to that folder once it is created.  Right click on the image thumbnail area (gray space) and click on add image.  Though it seems like you can only do one at a time, you can actually load in bulk.  Navigate to the directory holding your images.  Click on the first image of your group, then hold shift and click on the last image.  All images between the two will automatically be selected.  You can also select a group of various images by holding the CTRL key and clicking on each individually.<br>

The amount of images you can load in one grouping may vary depending on number of images and the overall size of the upload.  Try groups of 15-20 images and work your way up by adding 10 - 20 images to each selection.  If you try and load too many at once, you may receive an error.  Just reduce your number from there and try again
