<h1>Integrated Software Life-cycle Maintenance Options</h1>

<article>
<h2>Concept Overview</h2>

This policy covers software which will be built to leverage the Zoovy platform, and specifically for software will not run independently (autonomously) of the Zoovy platform.  

<br>

Acceptance of this policy is required prior to project commencement to make clients aware of their options regarding their future maintenance of the application, ideally before there is a problem.

<h2>Preamble</h2>

First – there are two relevant documents anybody considering custom software should review:<br>
<a class="linkdoc" href="#?doc=50905">Doc 50905</a> – describes the ongoing warranty related to design and development.
<a class="linkdoc" href="#?doc=51024">Doc 51024</a> – describes scoping projects to determine estimated costs.

</article>

<h2>Why this is necessary</h2>

The Zoovy platform is a SAAS (Software-As-A-Service), and is constantly evolving based on user feedback and changing market requirements.  While there are ways to lock a customer on a specific release of the software, the lack of enhancements and high maintenance costs generally makes this approach infeasible.  

<br>

The evolution of SAAS software poses a concern for non-autonomous (“integrated”) applications which are coupled to the Zoovy platform.  Each “touch point” which is used to link Zoovy with the integrated application creates an opportunity for disruption in the application.  While our staff works diligently to enhance our platform without disrupting integrated software,  it is reasonable to assume that given an infinite amount of time – a dependency will change in Zoovy's platform that will require updates to any integrated software.  If those changes are not made in a timely manner the integrated application will break, and could impact business operations depending on the application's role. The frequency of this occurring increases as the number of touch-points, and level of integration increases.

<h2>When will this happen?</h2>

Without a crystal ball which can see clearly into the future, there are no reliable formulas to predict when, or how this will happen.  In some cases the changes are mandated by a third party (such as eBay, Microsoft Internet Explorer, or Firefox) in the forms of a new incompatible release which requires we move very quickly to resolve any issues. 

<br>

This means that an integrated application, unless it is meticulously tested after each update – has the potential to break.  Zoovy does on average about 25 updates every day to the platform.  So testing after each update would come at a significant expense, easily dwarfing the original development cost.  Subsequently it is necessary to find an acceptable middle-ground which strikes the correct balances of application maintenance/availability, and the client's ongoing development maintenance budget.

<h2>What can be done about it.</h2>

Based on our observations from past projects we feel it is our responsibility to discuss maintenance plans before project commencement. 
Therefore we have created this policy to inform you, as a valued client that “software is not an investment, it is a liability which requires maintenance”.  
And to insure that before any project begins you have been informed of your ongoing life-cycle maintenance options so there are no surprises at the end of the project. 

<br>

Zoovy maintains anything we deem “core” for free.  If your application is designated as a “core enhancement” then it means you would have no continuing maintenance obligation, although funded by you, it will be generally available to all clients, and it will be tested, and maintained by Zoovy for free – at least until it is determined to be no longer viable at which time it would be removed from our service. Core also means we reserve the right to add or remove functionality, or change the behavior over time as it suits our user-base and business model. If you have been directed to this document, then your development is not “core”, and is not eligible for core.

Please remember:  All of our development projects are sent through a Q/A process and must be 'passed' prior to the project being considered complete.  This testing is included in the hourly price you pay for your project.

For non-core development we offer the following ongoing maintenance plans described below. 
<section>
<h3>Level 5: Critical Software Designation</h3>
Critical Software aka "Level 5" is a designation where Zoovy will extend warranties to non-core portions of software.  With this designation during initial development extra care will be taken to build in specific monitoring and health/wellness checks into the software. These checks are necessary to ensure fast remediation of any issues.  This software will have the highest level of availability, and also upfront and ongoing costs. 
Please review webdoc <a class="linkdoc" href="#?doc=50905">Doc 50905</a> for a more detailed explanation of Critical Software Designation.
This is considered an “ongoing project”
</section>

<section>
<h3>Level 4: Test Relevant Changes / Preventative Fixes</h3>
With this designation after each update which our staff identifies “could” impact the behavior of your integrated application we will perform testing. Your project will be charged for the time associated with the testing, and any development necessary to correct the problem.  The application “could” be down for a period time between the testing, and the corrections going into production which should normally be less than 1 business day. 
This is considered an “ongoing project”
</section>
<section>
<h3>Level 3: No Testing / Preventative Fixes</h3>
Zoovy will keep your application on file, if our staff is implicitly aware it that an impending update will definitely break the application – then it will be corrected, and your account will be charged for the development time associated to make the updates.  You will only be charged when we are absolutely certain an impending update will break the application, no authorization will be required for updates taking only a few minutes or hours.   
This is considered an “ongoing project”
</section>

<section>
<h3>Level 2: No Testing / Request Authorization</h3>
No testing will be performed, however we will attempt to notify you “best effort” when the application will require maintenance.  Approval will be required for any charges, and the application may remain broken until approval is obtained. 
Further any developer or project management time associated with preparing a cost estimate, or interactive discussion of the  changes are considered billable.  While many companies initially prefer the cost-control measures of this approach, it is important to recognize that the increased overhead costs and unacceptable delays involved with this approach actually make what would be minor issues into much more expensive endeavors – routinely adding several hours, and sometimes weeks to what would otherwise be quick 10 or 15 minute projects.   
This is not considered an ongoing project, new projects will need to be created for each change. 
</section>

<section>
<h3>Level 1: Inactive (No Testing / Do Not Fix)</h3>
If the integrated application will be broken, don't fix it, don't notify.  Projects should be changed to this level by the business owner when they are no longer used.

Please put the following in your project ticket:<br>

"I have read and understand Zoovy's obligations to lifecycle maintenance of integrated software applications. Please classify this project as a Level N"

<br>

(Be sure to replace "N" with the lifecycle maintenance plan you intend to use.
