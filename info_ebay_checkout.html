<h1>eBay Only Checkout</h1>

<article>
<h2>Concept Overview</h2>
 This document is to help you convert from eBay checkout redirect to the new eBay only Checkout.<br> 

Zoovy can now simplify your ebay checkout experience. Converting to eBay checkout is virtually seamless. When we switch you over to eBay checkout, it accomplishes the following 3 things:

<li>1. switches token setting (In Zoovy Profile)</li>
<li>2. attempts to revise all live ebay listings (In eBay)</li>
<li>3. sets global "EBAY-CHECKOUT" flag (In Zoovy Profile)</li>

<div>Be aware that Zoovy can only update your listings that have the ability to be edited per eBay guideline

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
The most important thing you must do to prepare for eBay checkout is to add a merchant account to eBay if you want the ability to accept Credit Card payments for your eBay orders. This is only mandatory if you use a processor other then paypal for credit card orders (i.e Authorize.net)


 Zoovy eBay Checkout Redirect will be discontinued on 6/10/09 and we will automatically convert your checkout method. However if you would like to be proactive and make the switch sooner, please setup your credit card merchant account with eBay and then open up a ticket with support to do the rest.

<div> If you accept credit cards for ebay orders you must setup a FREE "Paypal Payflow Pro" gateway in your ebay account, which is compatible with most (but not all) merchant accounts.
