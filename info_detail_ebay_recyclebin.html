<h1>eBay Recycling Bin</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<article>
<h2>Background</h2>

  eBay provides insertion fee credits to sellers for items which did not sell. 
  The policy is that eBay will refund the insertion credit on the first listing 
  if the item sells when it is listed the second time. This only works when an 
  item is relisted using the RelistItem form, rather than the AddItem form on 
  the eBay.com website.<br>
  <br>
  In the past Zoovy has offered a feature called "Relist One Time" which caused 
  a 7 day auction that did not sell to automatically relist for another 7 days. 
  However this has caused significant trouble with the Channel Scheduler feature, 
  which launches new listings at a time interval and cannot track if a listing 
  sold or was relisted. The effect was that a merchant would always have too many 
  of a poor selling item, or too few of a hot selling item.<br>
  <br>
  In addition if a seller forgot to revoke and/or remove a listing before canceling 
  it on eBay then the item would be automatically relisted. Finally relisting 
  could happen anywhere from a few minutes, to a few hours later. <br>
  <br>
  The eBay recycling bin was designed to solve these issues. <br>

<h2>About this Tool</h2>

  With the eBay recycling bin when an item does not sell, it's listing ID is stored 
  in a database. Then when a new product is listed using AddItem, the system checks 
  the recycling bin; if old auctions which could be relisted are available it 
  automatically performs a RelistItem instead of an AddItem. If the second item 
  sells, then the first item's fee are refunded by eBay.</p>
<p><strong>Caveats:</strong> 
<li>Items older than 90 days cannot be recycled. 
<li>Items must have the same or lower starting bid price
<li>Items must have the same or lower reserve price
 <li>Only the same item can be recycled, you cannot substitute one item for another.
<li> This only works one round, meaning if the item does not sell the 2nd time the 3rd time you launch the item it is being listed as a AddItem not RelistItem<br>
  <br>
  Please note: AddItem and RelistItem are eBay terms, not Zoovy terms.<br>
  <br>
  <b>To use this feature:</b><br>
  <br>
  The eBay recycling bin works automatically in the background; you don't have 
  to do anything. In other words, when you launch a new channel or relist an item 
  with  Zoovy's Scheduler or Powerlister, the system checks the recycling bin for 
  a match, it it finds one, the product is relisted on eBay using eBay's RelistItem, 
  as outlined above.<br

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div> Please disregard the channel status of a listing if it does not say recycled. When an item is relisted the channel status is not always accurate in reporting an item has been recycled.

  Please note: you can only have one recycling bin per seller, per Zoovy store.

<h2>Operational Details</h2>

  The eBay Gallery service will automatically use the RelistItem to the auctions 
  you launch through Zoovy. When an item is created from a recycled listing, it 
  will say "Recycled" instead of "Created" in the channel status. <br>
  In the future we may add additional features to this service, at that time to 
  update the settings simply look up the channel number and edit it.<br>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <b>Can I use multiple eBay usernames?</b><br>
  No the eBay Recycle Bin only supports one eBay username. <br>
  <b>I'm planning to change my eBay username, what can I do to make it go easier?</b><br>
  eBay allows you to specify an email address instead of a nickname, use your 
  registered email address in the username field with your regular eBay password 
  and everything should go fine.<br>
