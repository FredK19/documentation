<h1>Policy: Custom/Core Development Intellectual Property</h1>

<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>
This document discusses the ownership of intellectual property (copyrights and inventions) that are created as part of development work done by Zoovy.

</article>

<article>
<h2>Website Design/Graphics</h2>

Any artwork or design elements provided by the client remain property of the client.

<br>

Final approved website designs are property of the customer.  Zoovy encourages customers to file both copyrights on content, and trademarks on the overall aesthetic of the site. 

<br>

Previews and design concepts remain the property of Zoovy unless otherwise specified in an agreement. HTML or style sheet structure and naming conventions, Javascript, or other program code is not covered as part of the design and is considered Custom Development.

</article>

<article>
<h2>Core Program Code</h2>
Any core development created is considered sole property of Zoovy, regardless if it was done as part of a client project.   Core code is maintained by Zoovy at our cost, and is supported by Zoovy technical support, whereas costs to maintain custom code (hosted outside the core)  are the responsibility of the customer, and support (if any) is done by developers, or a specifically trained implementation staff member at the customers expense. 
<br>
Core code is any code hosted at www.zoovy.com, or that is executed directly on one on Zoovy's cluster/cloud architecture.

</article>

<article>
<h2>Custom Development</h2>

Custom development is any code that is hosted on an external hosting server (even if that server is owned and operated by Zoovy).  Custom code communicates with the Zoovy backend via an API or other similar interface. 

<br>

Any non-core/custom development performed is considered the property of the client and Zoovy.  Zoovy reserves the right to take part, or all of the custom development into the core at a future date, in our sole discretion. 

</article>

<article>
<h2>Differences between Core and Custom development</h2>

Because core code runs within our cloud architecture and has the ability to affect many clients - the Zoovy Core code is engineered at a different level, with additional documentation and compatibility checking since it is necessary that it works for thousands of clients, whereas custom code need only work for one client and so it requires less documentation, less testing, and less thought about the long term implications of design decisions.  In some cases we may develop client code for the core, in those cases the client will only be billed for the “non-core” portions that are specific to the client.

<h2>Toolbox Libraries</h2>

Zoovy has developed a series of toolbox libraries to help with common tasks, these improve our ability to cost effectively deliver projects while minimizing bugs because they use known working functions.  This is a very common practice with programmers. 

<br>

While we retain the copyright on our toolboxes, we consider these toolbox libraries to be public domain and customers are welcome to take them with them (free of charge) if they are used in a project. 

<br>

Zoovy may also - either during, or after the project completion take portions of any project and incorporate those into our general toolbox for future projects.   
No guarantees are made that our toolbox will not be used by a company who is, or may become a competitor - Zoovy does not block or prohibit clients from specific industries as a result of a custom development project.

<h2>Relicensing Custom Development Applications</h2>
Since Zoovy shares the rights to any program code it would be legal for us to relicense the complete application (minus any graphics) to another client. 
<br>
While a client is an active paying customer on our system - Zoovy will not sell or license their same exact “complete” non-core application to a client without prior consent from the client. 
<br>
In no circumstances would we ever knowingly propose copying the application to a competitor in the same industry as the client.   However in the absence of a non-compete, we may offer to create a similar application for a competitor and in those cases we will start from the ground up (but probably using the same development libraries/toolboxes that are used on all projects). 

<br>

If we have a situation where two companies are non-competitive, and we feel it is appropriate to copy the complete application we will request the new client to pay a license fee for the complete application.  Zoovy will provide all or a portion of that license fee to the client as a credit to their invoice (to offset their development costs), with a portion going to Zoovy for re-testing, and for any additional customizations the new client wants.  This is a common situation for things like interfaces to accounting/ERP systems, or other 3rd parties that cross multiple industries.
<br>

Here at Zoovy we feel it would be highly unethical, and a breech of client trust to take a complete application and handing it to a competitor at no cost, however we also do not intend to police this, and we are not in an effective position to police or restrict what our clients decide to sell today or tomorrow (outside of what is legal to sell).  
For this reason in all circumstances the client agrees that Zoovy is the sole arbiter of "what is fair", our goal is to maintain happy clients, and to make all of our clients successful.

<h2>Can I pay extra to own 100% of my application</h2>

Zoovy does not not accept projects where the clients retain 100% ownership of Intellectual Property. There are three reasons for this policy:

<br>

1. Cost: Any copyright case that is prosecuted by a competent IP attorney will require an 
upfront retainer of no less than $200,000.
This routinely more than the actual cost of producing the software. 
While there are specialized insurance policies, adequate coverage would be at least $5m, 
for the duration of the scope of the agreement (example 10 years), which would be at 
least $50,000 in premiums alone which would need to be factored into the project cost.
In addition the copious reference checking would substantially add to the cost of the 
project - easily more than tripling the actual project cost.

<br>

2. Historical Copyrights: Zoovy does maintain historical registered-copyrights of code on all prior projects, or in some cases our own code.  So we are unable to prove that we had something before the clients project and that it wasn't "invented" as part of the project.
Effectively this could compromise the entire Zoovy source code tree. 
We also utilize open source extensively and if a bug is found in an open source
module we will generally submit patches back to the source repository and this also
has legal ramifications.
In either case - if a client wants us to do a project where they will own 100% of the
IP then they would need to effectively buy Zoovy - our current valuation is around
$20m. 

<br>

3. Headache: We are not a custom development shop, we do custom development as a favor to our clients.  We don't want to do custom development, we don't really try to make money 
at it and so it's really easy for us to turn down projects that we don't want to do,
and the extra hassle involved in "client owns 100% IP" projects aren't the type of
work we want to do.

<h2>Non-Competes vs. 100% IP Ownership</h2>
We should dispel a common misconception: 
<br>
100% ownership of IP does NOT prohibit us (or any company) from selling software or service to the competition, it only requires that a developer rebuild the same software from the ground up, (minus any inventions or proprietary algorithms provided by the client).  
Working around inventions may mean "doing it a bit harder", but still being able to do it. In most cases clients who are asking about 100% ownership of IP are actually looking
to block their competitors. 

<br>

Zoovy does, in select cases, offer clients the ability to block either specific identified
competitors or entire industries. 
The costs for a non-compete are determined based on the size of the potential market,
and the scope, and duration of the agreement, and if the agreement is terminable
by either party (or just by the client). 

<br>

We would only consider accepting non-competes from clients who are actively selling, and who currently rank as one of the top 3 sellers within their specific market/industry they are looking to have exclusive access to. (Sorry, absolutely no start ups)

<br>

In all cases Zoovy will only enter into non-competes where clients are actively 
paying us not to pursue opportunities.  The minimum value will be at least $10,000/yr.
