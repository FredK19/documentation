<h2>So what is HTML and what can I do with it?</h2>

HTML stands for hypertext markup language, it is a scripting language  which is used by web browsers to build webpages. This document is written in HTML, as are all the other webpages on the Internet you surf. Basic HTML is very easy to learn, in fact anybody can do it. Knowing HTML will allow you to do neat things like bold text, center text, or even include other images on your page.

<h2>How does HTML work?</h2>

HTML works on the idea that there is meta information inside each document. Meta information contains special codes that tell the browser how to format the text, every browser uses the same codes because the codes are standardized by an international committee known as the W3C -WWW Consortium. HTML uses the idea that anything between a less than < and a greather than > is a meta tag. Tags have both a beginning and an end, here is an example: <metatag>formatted text</metatag>. If metatag was a real tag then the browser would have performed some nifty formatting to words formatted text between the two tags. If this seems a bit confusing don't worry it will be made clear in a second.

<h2>A simple formatting example, using soft returns</h2>

Probably the most common tag is a BR tag, which is nothing more than < b r > this will cause the text to stop
and go to the next line. So anytime you want to end a paragraph simply insert a < b r > and the text stop and the next word will begin at the next line. Don't worry the < b r >won't be visible to the viewer since its between a less than < greater than > the web browser won't display it.

<h2>Providing emphasis, using bold and italics</h2>

There are three text formatting tags which you can use to bold, underline or italicize text.
<li>The B tag turns text bold example: <b>bold text</b> non-bold text.
<li>The I tag turns text italic example: <i>italic text</i> non-italic text.
<li>The U tag turns text underline example: <u>underline text</u> non-underline text.

<h2>Alignment of text</h2>

So you want to center things? The browser can do this for you using the < center > tag. For example:
<center>This text is centered</center>

<h2>Using Fonts Tags</h2>

Font tags can control the size, and color of the auction. Font tags are structured slightly differently than the bold and italic tags because. The syntax for a font tag is:
<font color="blue" size="3" face="arial">blue text size 3 in arial</font>
REMEMBER: you must always remember put the < /font > tag at the end of the text string for formatting with fonts in HTML.

<h2>Solutions to common problems</h2>

Problem: After inserting my HTML part of my text disappeared.<br>
Solution: This is most commonly caused by having a missing end tag. Look for orphan < or > tags. Remember in HTML for every < there MUST be a >, and ANYTHING in between a < and a > will not be displayed (even if there is no ending >).
