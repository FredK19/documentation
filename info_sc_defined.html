<h1>Supply Chain Overview</h1>

<article>
<h2>Supply Chain Purpose</h2>






Zoovy's Supply Chain functionality allows you to send an order to a supplier automatically, update your inventory automatically from a remote source and calculate shipping based on a supplier's location as opposed to your location.

<h2>Order Delivery</h2>
Order Delivery is a basic part of Supply Chain. There are several ways of delivering an order, depending on your business model and specific needs.
<section>
<h3>JEDI</h3>
If you have setup Supply Chain with another Zoovy store, you may use what we call "JEDI" (or Just Easy Data Integration). This means that your order is automatically sent over to the other Zoovy store for fulfillment. It is the easiest form of Supply Chain.

<h3>Email</h3>
The most common way of sending an order to a non-Zoovy supplier (or "Generic" supplier) is via email. This email order will include a form that your supplier can fill out and submit upon completion of the order so that you are kept up to date on the status of the order, shipping and tracking information, etc.

<section>
<h3>Fax</h3>
An order may be faxed to a supplier rather than emailed.

<h3>API</h3>
Zoovy can by special arrangement construct a custom solution that will dispatch an order in a specific format for a merchant. An API solution requires additional cost and approval of our development department. The price of the API solution is dependent upon the complexity of the programming that will be necessary. If you would like to pursue an API solution please contact your Account Manager.

<h2>Inventory Updates</h2>
Zoovy's Supply Chain feature can dynamically update inventory numbers from a remote database or spreadsheet, if that data is available.

<h2>What else can Supply Chain do?</h2>
<section>
<h3>Stock Supply Chain</h3>
Stock Supply Chain will automatically place an order with your supplier (or remind you that you need to re-order) when you reach a certain threshold. A merchant can set a minimum on shelf quantity per item, a minimum order amount, specific order days or a combination of this criteria to trigger the Stock Supply Chain module. 
</section>
<section>
<h3>Fulfillment</h3>
Zoovy can send the order and payment information for an order directly to a supplier. This is typically done for merchants that have an arrangement with fulfillment houses in which the supplier directly receives payment and then pays the merchant a commission after the completion of the order.
