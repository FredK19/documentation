<h2>Setup</h2>

Please ensure the nameservers for your domain to point to:
<br>
Primary: ns.zoovy.com<br>
Secondary: ns2.zoovy.com<br>
<br>
<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>If your Domain was registered through Zoovy then your nameservers are already
configured properly.
</div>
</aside>


Once you have done this then you can configure your mail client to access:
webmail.yourdomain.com<br>
<br>
Your email client should be configured as follows:<br>
<li> Username: admin@yoursitename.zoovy.com 
<li> POP Server: pop.fusemail.net
<li> IMAP Server: imap.fusemail.net
<li> SMTP Server: smtp.fusemail.net
<br>
<br>
Zoovy will configure SPF (Sender Permitted Framework) records for both the
Zoovy mail servers, and the ZoovyMail service (hosted by FuseMail). This will inform the rest of the 
Internet that only servers authorized by Zoovy are allowed to send mail from your
domain. This protects you and your customers from both rogue viruses and spammers
who could otherwise hijack your domain.  You must send email from your domain out through smtp.fusemail.net.<br>

<h2>Special Circumstances</h2>


Certain Internet Service Provider such as Cox Cable, or Netscape
Internet restrict the ability to send mail to only their mail servers.
This may be a problem if you notice that when sending email, the mail
program hangs and eventually produces an error about a server timeout.
Most of the time this can be easily circumvented by using port 2500 of
smtp.fusemail.net for outbound SMTP instead of port 25 (the default).
In the place where you configure your outbound mailserver SMTP settings to
use smtp.fusemail.net, look for the "25" and change it to be "2500".<br>
