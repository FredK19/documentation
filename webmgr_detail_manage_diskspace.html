<h1>Disk Space Management</h1>
<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>




The Disk Space Manager allows you to view the amount of space currently in use by your account.
It also includes tools for removing orphaned images which are often the largest culprit of wasted space.

To reduce server load and provide equal access to all customers the Disk Space Tool is only available during off peak hours.

<h2>Compute Space</h2>

The "Compute Disk Space" button displays the amount of disk space used by key portions of your website.
You may notice the sum of all the areas may be less than the TOTAL_USAGE this is because 
some hidden files cannot be displayed, but are computed in the TOTAL_USAGE.
As a rule these hidden files typically contain less than 1mb of content.

The IMAGES directory also includes your custom files.

<h2>Remove Orphaned Images</h2>

When you click the remove orphaned images the system will attempt to compile a list of unused images.
It does this by going through every product, every page, along with your company logo, and merchant profile.
When you click the button a list of images, along with thumbnails will be displayed. 
If you have a lot of products and pages then the list may take a while to build, be patient.
To remove an image simply check the box next to the image and then go to the bottom of the list and push 
the button labeled "Remove all Images".

There is intentionally no "Select All" box, this is to avoid unnecessarily deleting images.

It is your responsibility to visually verify when an image is no longer in use.
Zoovy assumes no liability for the orphaned images script - it may not be 100% accurate (this is because it very problematic to verify exactly what links to an image).
There is a fee associated with performing an image recovery from our backup system - so don't delete an image unless you are sure you don't need it, or you have backups.
