The Quickbooks client allows you to easily export any invoices which have changed or been updated from your Zoovy store into the native Quickbooks import file.

<h2>Considerations/Limitations:</h2>

There are some special considerations for Quickbooks users, the most important is you can only import the invoices in single user mode when the admin user is logged in. This is a limitation of Quickbooks which appeared in Quickbooks 1999 for which there is no solution. 
Solution: Plan on using the multi-user abilities of the Zoovy order manager to perform a nightly, or even a weekly synchronization between Zoovy and Quickbooks during offpeak hours when employees are not logged in, use the Zoovy Order manager for your day-to-day operations. Besides our invoice and customer looks are faster and easier to use. ;-)

<h2>Invoices</h2>

Invoices from Quickbooks will NOT appear in Zoovy. If you need this functionality please contact Zoovy technical support, nobody has requested it so we haven't written it yet!
</article>
<article>
<h2>Changed Invoices</h2>

If an invoice has changed on Zoovy, then it's timestamp will be incremented and the the invoice will be re-exported, Quickbooks will complain that the invoice number is a duplicate. In these circumstances you will normally need to click "Yes" to overwrite, if you continually re-update old invoices this can be a real pain. Howevera again this is a limitation of Quickbooks, which cannot be overcome.

<h2>What does the Convert Underscores to Dashes option do?</h2>

If you have existing SKU's from Quickbooks which you have, or are planning to import into Zoovy then you may notice that Zoovy translates those dashes to underscores when creating product id's. If you plan on correlating those product id's back from Zoovy then you need to convert the underscores back to dashes -or go into quickbooks and rename all your products to use underscores rather than dashes-.
