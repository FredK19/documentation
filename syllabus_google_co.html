<h2>Google Checkout Configuration</h2>





<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>Google Checkout is direct competition for PayPal. As a result, eBay is not supporting Google Checkout. If you are an eBay seller do not use Google Checkout on the same partition as your eBay auctions.

<div> You should create your Google Checkout account in the same Google account that you use Adwords.

<h6>Setting Up Google Checkout</h6>
<div>
<li> Go to checkout.google.com and setup a buyer's account.
<li> You need a buyer's account before creating a seller's account.
<li> In Google Checkout, go to Settings > Integration to find your Google Merchant ID and Google Merchant Key.
<li> Return to Zoovy and bring your Google Merchant ID and Google Merchant Key into Setup > Payment Methods > Google Checkout.
<li> At the bottom of the Google Checkout page in Zoovy, you will find the Callback URL. You want to copy this and paste it into the  "API callback URL" box in Google Checkout under Settings > Integration.
<li> Make sure you have the Google Checkout logo on your site where needed. (This is not optional.)

<div>Google branding requires that you have the Google Checkout icon adjacent to any link that says "Checkout" on your webstore.
</div>

The Google Checkout badge will appear on your GoogleBase and Google Adwords ads after you have completed a transaction paid for with Google Checkout on your website.

<aside class="cbc">
<h6>Optional - First / Last Name</h6>
<div>
Google sends us the buyers full name, not separated into First and Last.  Usually we are able to separate them correctly, but not always.  If this is important to you, then take the following steps:
<li> Log in to your Google merchant account.
<li> Click on the Settings tab.
<li> Click the Integration link on the left side of the page.
<li> Expand the list of advanced settings and check the box next to the setting that says, "Provide the first name, last name and full name of the buyer and order recipient in separate fields in the new order notification."
<li> Click the Save button to update your settings.
