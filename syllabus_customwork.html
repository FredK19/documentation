<h2>Overview</h2>
If you are reading this page, chances are you just got a bunch of templates from your graphic designer.  Congrats!  It's an exciting time and perhaps a little overwhelming.  Below is a list of the various template types and links to other pages in webdoc which contain detailed editing instructions.
<br>
The information below and linked to from this page will provide general instructions on how to use the templates.  In some cases, you may have some feature or functionality which is specific to your template/account.  Those types of instructions are either on the original project ticket or within the template itself (and will appear in the editor).

<section>
<h3>A note on the End of Project (EOP) Letter</h3>

Throughout this document, you will find sections on 'how to test a ...' which will provide general things to look for when testing.  When you submit your EOP, please be detailed.  For instance, if an error only occurs when you add three paragraphs of text, note that on your numbered list. Compare the two examples below.  Which do you think will require us to ask you for more information and slow down the process of completing the project?

<br>

#3 - the text at the bottom of the layout doesn't work right.
<br>
#3 - on layout XYZ, when I add three paragraphs of text to the bottom text block, it runs over the footer.
<br>
Describe the error, how you got the error to occur, and where it happened.  If you have questions about testing, you can contact your designer or you can schedule an appointment with the implementation specialist for assistance.

<h2>Website Themes and Popup Themes (aka wrappers)</h2>

The theme is the elements that appear on every (or nearly every) page of your store, such as the logo, categories, footer, etc.
<br>
Selecting and editing your theme is covered at the link below:
<a class="linkdoc" href="#?doc=50270">Doc 50270</a> 
<br>
The popup theme is used for features such as tell a friend, customer review and other features where a popup on the website is used.  To maintain branding, the popup theme is used.
<br>
Selecting and editing your popup theme is covered at the link below:

<h3>How to test a theme</h3>
The best way to test the theme is to select it.  Once the theme is selected, start clicking all the links.  Do they work?  If they don't, make a note of what you clicked that resulted in a broken page.  The categories are typically auto-generated, so if one works, they'll all work.  Click a few to make sure they work properly.
<br>
Compare the site in different browsers.  Open it in Internet Explorer and FireFox.  Does it look the same?  Does it look like the preview?
<br>
Go in to the theme editor from the website builder.  Edit the editable elements (text, banners, etc).  Do they all work properly?  When enabled, does the element appear where it should?  You should test each element individually to make sure it's working properly.
<br>
Colors and buttons - Visit one of your product detail pages.  Does the add to cart button match the rest of the store?  Push it and then view the buttons on the cart page.  Do they match?  Does the color of the cart match the rest of the site?
<br>
Last but not least, while the wrapper is selected, visit one of your secure pages, such as 'my account', 'login' or the checkout process (note that the cart page is not a secure page).  Is the page secure?  You'll know in IE right away because a big 'non-secure items' warning will appear.  FireFox is more subtle and will show an unlocked lock in the address bar.

<div>
If you have an existing store, you can test late and night or in the early morning before peak traffic times and then switch back to your current theme till after the corrections are made.

</div>
</aside>


Popup themes can be tested easily enough.  Just select them in the appropriate place in the builder, then click the 'tell a friend' or 'reviews' button on a product detail page.  The page that appears uses the popup theme.  Typically, there are not editable elements so you do not need to test the popup theme in the editor, just make sure it looks good in both IE and FireFox.

<h2>Email Templates</h2>


The email template is used for outbound system messages, such as new order created, auction notifications, etc. Email templates themselves contain no editable elements.  They may share some banners, links or other inputs with the theme.  The content of the email messages are all editable through the editor.
<br>
Selecting your email template and editing the content is covered at the link below:
<a class="linkdoc" href="#?doc=50291">Doc 50291</a> 


<section>
<h3>How to Test an Email Template</h3>
To test an email, you must select in through the website builder.  Once you have selected the template, click the 'edit' link to get in to the email messages page. Click the 'OCREATE' message button.  Type your email into the 'from email' field and push test.  Check your email.  Note that some email applications require you to 'enable images' for a given message before the graphics will show up.
<br>
Send yourself the email to multiple email accounts with different email browsers.  Try to check it in the major applications - outlook, thunderbird, gmail and hotmail to make sure all the necessary text is legible.

<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>
It is impossible to build an email template with any degree of customization (meaning more than a white background with text) that will look good in 100% of the email applications on the market.  It is expected that in some email applications, subtle differences will be present and not preventable.

<h2>Page Layouts</h2>

<section>
<h3>Product Pages</h3>
Product detail pages are a little different than all the other page types in the system because these are product specific.  So, they're edited through the product editor.  In most cases, the information displayed on the product detail page can be edited through the general product editor.  If you have custom fields, you'll need to go one step further into the template. The following page in webdoc contains instructions:
<a class="linkdoc" href="#?doc=50317">Doc 50317</a> (specifically, read the sections on 'design web page' and most likely 'cross selling'.

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
In most cases, the designer sets the theme up to 'force' on the product layout.  This saves you the trouble of selecting it for each product and ensures consistency throughout your customers shopping experience.

</div>
</aside>


</section>

<section>
<h3>All Other Pages (category, home, results, etc</h3>
All the other page types can be edited through the website builder.  There are several pages that might be of interest to you.  They are listed below with brief descriptors.

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
In most cases, the layouts for these pages must be selected manually through the website builder.  A home or results layout may be 'forced' on by the theme.  The Category layouts can not be, so they must be selected manually or through a CSV import.

<h3>How to Test a Layout</h3>

The best way to test a layout is to select it.  If you have a custom theme that was designed at the same time, test these two together, as there may be some dependencies in place which require the correct theme to be present.

<br>

For non-product pages, go into the website builder and edit a page with the layout in question.  Click 'edit' next to all the editable elements and select different images or set different text (depending on the type of element).  Save and then view it on the website.  Did the new text/image show up in the right place?  If your layout has multiple product lists, define a different source for each prodlist and make sure the correct products are showing up in the correct lists.

<br>

Product pages are a bit more involved to test because there is (potentially) such a wide variety of elements which can be present.
Once again, you need to select the product layout and the theme before testing.  I'd suggest creating (if your designer hasn't already done so) a test product.  Populate the test product with all the data used in the templace (price, description, name, etc).  Then visit the product page in your store.
How does it look?<br>
Do all the links work?<br>
Write a review for this item and make sure that works (note that you need to approve the review before it appears on the storefront)<br>
Push tell a friend and send yourself a message<br>
Add the item to the cart<br>
If you use product options, make sure you enable some and that the options appear as needed<br>
If your layout supports accessories and/or related items, make sure you select products and test those features

<h2>Auction Templates</h2>

Auction templates are used when syndicating your products to ebay or to your ebay store.  Your store policies can be set through the company information page of the profile you are launching with.
<br>
Selecting your auction template can be found here:

<div>If you have auctions running and want to run a live update, follow these instructions:
<ol>
<li>Click the utilities tab.</li>
<li>Click the 'eBay Account Setup' link.</li>
<li>Click the 'profiles' link.</li>
<li>Click the 'refresh listings' link.</li>
</ol>

<i>Note – This will not change auctions that have already had 1 bid.</i>

<section>
<h3>How to Test an Auction Template</h3>

There are ways to test an auction template without launching, however before submitting your EOP, you should launch at least one item, to make sure that the code that ebay outputs onto the page has no effects on your auction template.

Typically, you'll want to create a TEST profile so that your active profile isn't affected.  Once you have the profile created, set the policies through the profile editor.  Then, go in to the product editor and open a product (if you have a test product, that would be a good one to work with).  Click the 'launch channel' button and then select a marketplace (ebay or overstock will work).  Choose the test profile and push the preview button. Once the preview pane appears, you'll see a 'fullscreen preview' button underneath.  Push that.  Take a look and make sure it appears as needed.  If you leave this window open, you can edit the product in another window and make changes.  Then, refresh the preview pane and it will reload with the edited fields.

<br>
Most of the time, all of the policies are required.  The sections, if blank, may not appear, but the links to those sections likely will unless specified by you prior to construction that you will not have one of these policies.  The product specific information should appear/disappear gracefully if not populated.  Test this. Add more images.  remove images.  Add and remove text.  Everything still look good.

<h2>Newsletter Templates</h2>

Newsletters are used to send campaigns out to your customers on a weekly, monthly or some other scheduled event. The newsletter goes out to customers and potential customers that have opted in through your website.
<br>
How to use the newsletter tool can be found in the following doc:
<a class="linkdoc" href="#?doc=50394">Doc 50394</a>

<h3>How to Test a Newsletter template</h3>
To test a newsletter, you need to create a campaign and select the template.  This is covered in detail at the link below:
<a class="linkdoc" href="#?doc=50394">Doc 50394</a>

Populate all of the editable fields, including the product lists, and make sure everything appears where it should appear.  Turn things on/off and make sure the newsletter content behaves as expected (empty elements should not take up space).

<br>
Send yourself the newsletter to multiple email accounts with different email browsers.  Try to check it in the major applications - outlook, thunderbird, gmail and hotmail to make sure all the necessary text is legible.

<h2>Flash</h2>

Sometimes your theme or layout may contain flash.  Typically, this will be one of our flash applets listed below.  If it is something more custom, specific directions will be in the template itself, which you can access through the editor specific to that template (builder for themes, layouts and emails, newsletter manager for newsletters, etc).

<section>
<h3>Banner Rotator</h3>
The banners that are displayed in the rotator can be selected through the editor.  In most cases, these are located in layouts and you can edit them through the website builder.  The transition can also be selected in that editor.  The transition is global for that flash, so you can not select a wipe for image 1 and a slide for image 2.  Set your images, urls and duration through the editor by clicking 'edit' next to the 'flash banner editor' prompt.
</section>


<section>
<h3>Product Exhibitor (deal of the day, week, etc)</h3>
This flash piece works off of our RSS feature.  The RSS feed, if it was not already created by you, was most likely created by your product manager. The template that the flash is loaded into may contain some instructions.
</section>


<section>
<h3>Multi-item Product Rotator (multi = more than 1 per 'slide')</h3>
This flash is typically hard coded to point to up to 5 different RSS feeds.  The template will contain instructions on which feeds the rotator is pointing to.
</section>



<section>
<h3>Single-item Product Rotator (single = 1 at a time)</h3>
This flash is typically hard coded to point to up to a RSS feed.  The template will contain instructions on which feeds the rotator is pointing to.
