<h2>Issue</h2>


<br>


We've signed up to try some Fulfillment by Amazon.  How does Zoovy handle these orders?  We don't want to ship them twice, but we still need them pulled down so we can export to Quickbooks and reconcile properly.

Thanks.

<h2>Resolution</h2>

Amazon doesn't currently support integration for this feature (though they have plans to). You will need to export the orders and then import them into your Zoovy store.

Please setup an implementation appointment for assistance with this process.

We will let you know as soon Amazon has this integration in place.
