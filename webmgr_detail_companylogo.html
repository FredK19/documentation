<h1>Company Logo</h1>

<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>
Zoovy allows you to upload a different logo for each profile.  The logo selected will be used on the store, auctions and emails associated with that profile.  You can select a different logo for invoices, which should be black and white and have your domain name in it.

<h2>The importance of your logo</h2>

<p>Your companyâ€™s logo is its identity. A logo is a tiny advertisement for your company that gives your customers an easy way of remembering who you are, and what you do. The design of your logo should communicate the name of your company and what it does. In cases where the name of your company does not clearly indicate your business, you should add a tagline.</p>

<p>A logo, by definition, consists of a mark and/or your company name.  If you sell pet supplies, putting your company name on a picture of your sisters dog is not a good logo.  Pictures don't translate well to black and white (not greyscale, think photocopy) which means you can't use them on letterheads, business cards or invoices. Take time and choose/purchase the right logo.</p>

<h2>Invoice logo</h2>
On the same page in the click-by-click above, you can set an 'invoice logo'.  This should be a black and white (not greyscale) version of your logo (png or transparent gif preferred, but a jpg on a white background will work.  This is the logo that will be used for printing invoices.  Selecting a different logo here will not affect the appearance of your logo on the website.

<h2>Logo's and Zoovy</h2>
<p>The dimensions of the logo will be determined by the theme that you are using.  Each theme is designed to have the logo in a very specific size.  If your logo is wide, but the theme is designed for a tall, narrow logo then you should choose a different theme.</p>

<p>If you want portions of the image to be transparent then you will need to upload either a GIF or a PNG file. These are the only two image formats which support transparency. A PNG image will produce a better result than a GIF.</p>

<p><b>How do I get rid of that background?</b><br>
There are two ways to get rid of the background on your logo. The first is to go ahead and use a transparent background which is supported by the GIF and PNG file format. The second is to use a JPG which has a similar background and texture to the theme you are using.</p>

<p><b>How big should the logo be?</b><br>
There are hundreds of themes in the Zoovy system, which incorporate a variety of logo sizes. We recommend that you upload the largest version of the logo that you have.  Our system will resize it to fit the theme you have selected.</p>

<p><b>When I upload my image with a transparent background it has a outer glow to it?</b><br>
Your graphics software has "Anti-Aliasing" enabled, this is a very common algorithm that software uses to smooth out the edges of an image. When you disable Anti-Aliasing you might notice your images can get very jaggy (especially curves), if this happens to your image then you need to leave anti-aliasing enabled and then transpose your logo onto a similar background color as your theme, this way the outer glow will blend into the background.</p>
