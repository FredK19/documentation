<h2>Issue #159696: Google Checkout badges not appearing</h2>

I have implemented all the things for google checkout and have completed a test order.

Why isn't the google checkout icon appearing in the google searches that display my results.

Anything else I have to do to get that to appear?

<h2>Answer</h2>

In order for the checkout icon to appear in your Adwords you will need to link your Adwords account to your Google Checkout account.  Here is a web doc that explains how to do this.

You will have to process one complete sale through Google Checkout before the icons start showing on your Adwords.
