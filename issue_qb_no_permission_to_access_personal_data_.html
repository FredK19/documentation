<h2>Resolution</h2>

There is a toggle that needs to be checked in oder to "Allow this application to have
access Social Security Numbers, credit card information, and other personal
data" within Quickbooks that should resolve this issue.
<br>
<li>1. Run Quick books
<li>2. Go to Edit -> Preferences 
<li>3. Click on Integrated Application
<li>4. Click on Company Preferences
<li>5. Click On Zoovy Integrated Desktop 7.xx and hit properties
<li>6. Check  "Allow this application to have access Social Security Numbers,credit card information, and other personal data"
<li>7. Click Ok to save that option, then Ok to exit preferences, and this should remove the error.
