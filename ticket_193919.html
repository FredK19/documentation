Issue: auction template and ebay header

<br>

Platform: na
Topic: users_website

i know that you have design team which does custom auction templates.
 I like to have a custom template for my ebay listing.
something as following would be a good start.

Is this something your design team can help with or I will have to outsource this.

Hello Sadeem,

I am having liz, our project manager, turn this into a project so that you can move forward with Jerry, one of our designers. He can take care of getting you an auction template and matching ebay store header.

Thanks,

Sadeem,

I have your examples of what you'd like your custom auction template to look like. Would you like me to go ahead and have a preview generated or did you want to speak with me first. If you'd like to schedule a meeting, pls book it through the support queue and include a phone number.

Not sure if anyone has discussed pricing with you, but Auction Templates and Ebay Headers typically take about 10 hours to design and build. The only info I have on the hourly rate is here: http://webdoc.zoovy.com/doc/50551

If you ave any questions, please contact Mitch in sales or myself and I will get you to Mitch.

Sadeem,

I went over the examples you provided and my notes from our meeting with a developer. It turns out the project would be the first of that kind. Normally we just do an ebay header and the auction template. This is not to say we can't do a custom store front, but it may take more time and work to get it right. He said it would likely be closer to 15hours. Just wanted to give you a heads up.

I will wait for the sales to call me with the price and then I will make my decision on it.

How many hours would it take you to just an auction template with what I asked for .
