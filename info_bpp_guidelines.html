<h1>Best Partner Practices Participation Guidelines &amp; Approved Partner List</h1>





<article>
<h2>Concept Overview</h2>

We view your website as a partnership between our technology &amp; services and your business ingenuity and determination. The intent of the Best Partner Practices (BPP) program is to maximize the long term probability of success for your business by providing stable "trusted configurations".  
<br>

You can read more about the BPP and it's goals here:

<h2>BPP Participation Guidelines</h2>

<section>
<h3>Site Appearance</h3>
As a BPP Member you are required to maintain a professional look and feel for your website and marketplace listings. If your website looks bad, it not only hurts your sales but also impacts Zoovy's ability to solicit potential clients.     

<br>
 
Specifically, but not limited to: 
<li> Use of Wiki Text to ensure a consistent look and feel throughout the site and greatest compatibility with marketplaces, and is required for use with AJAX technology.  (Zoovy provides HTML to Wiki conversion services)
<li> No un-authorized logos/banners/plugins – such as SitePal.com
<li> No “random” HTML e.g. &lt;h1&gt; tags,  or extremely large text blocks on pages. 
<li> No annoying survey popups, generic (non-matching) random chat pop-ups, site music, animated cartoons or other things which may distract/annoy shoppers. 
<li> No Google Adsense, or other off-site Affiliate links (without prior approval) – these are typically very disruptive to the flow of the site, and can in some circumstances break the shopping experience. 
<li> All design elements of the site should be complementary in appearance to present a consistent look and feel throughout the site. 

</section>

<section>
<h3>System Usage</h3>

BPP clients should use the Order Manager, or Web Order Management – but never concurrently for the same order.  Use of 3rd party order processing systems can cause a variety of issues regarding data integrity.  

<br>

If you change a setting in DNS, checkout, shipping, or payment with assistance you should always place an order on your own website following the change to test the new changes. 

</section>

<section>
<h3>DNS/E-Mail</h3>
Clients are expected to utilize the ZoovyMail platform for their business operations, this ensures the greatest level of compatibility and integration with the Zoovy platform.  ZoovyMail is powered by FuseMail.com and is a full featured business oriented email platform that we have been quite happy with.

<br>

BPP clients are encouraged to transfer their domains to our registrar to avoid possible disruption from threats, in addition to easier management.  Using Zoovy as the registrar can avoid domain hijacking scenarios which while rare are incredibly disruptive to a business when they occur.  There are many threats which specifically target popular registrars such as GoDaddy.
</section>


<section>
<h3>Credit Card Processing/Payment gateway</h3>

BPP clients are expected to use only “recommended” payment gateways (versus 'integrated' or 'supported' gateways).  Recommended gateways include: Authorize.Net, or Paypal Payflow Pro or Paypal Website Payments Pro. 

<br>

BPP clients using Authorize.Net are encouraged to use our recommended processor – e-onlinedata, this ensures the highest compatibility.  However we prefer Paypal for their aggressive pricing, and phenomenal customer service and treatment of Zoovy clients. 

</section>

<section>
<h3>IT Infrastructure</h3>

Recommend businesses to employ or contract with a designated IT person/firm who is capable of executing simple configuration instructions to systems. This person should generally be available to Zoovy staff during normal business hours in order to troubleshoot any issues with equipment that may arise.  Zoovy provides "GEEK" services as a billable service to clients who do not retain this type of organization.  

<br>
BPP Clients are encouraged to have at least one PC running the Order Manager desktop client for shipping, all computers connected to Zoovy should be maintained with the latest security patches. All computers that access the Zoovy.com backend must use a hardware firewall to connect to the Internet.   
<br>
BPP Clients must employ Virus & Spyware protection on your PC's to minimize the potential for disruption of the Zoovy software, as well as to minimize your risk of having data stolen.  Issues caused by failing to have a up-to-date virus and spyware suite are not covered by our free support policies. 
<br>
It is also worth mentioning the requirements above are part of the PCI Compliance required by all Merchant Account Providers. 
</section>

<section>
<h3>Integration of non-trusted 3rd party systems/services/plug-ins</h3>
Keeping our system running means we need to be diligent on what is installed/running on our clients websites. Each piece of software/service that is added increases the opportunity for something to break. The Zoovy platform is amazingly robust, but also highly complex – subsequently care is necessary to ensure applications not only work today, but will continue to work tomorrow as the Zoovy platform evolves. 

<br>

We recommend clients have us install and test 3rd party plugins.  Installation and troubleshooting of non-trusted applications is done as a billable service.  However if an application is deployed correctly in the first place it is far less likely to have issues and the appropriate notes will be setup on the account to ensure that if something goes wrong it will be resolved expeditiously.  

<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>
Some older BPP agreements require the use of ONLY trusted configurations. Other agreements require that clients have Zoovy install any non-supported application.  Please refer to your specific agreement to determine what your specific obligations in order to avoid contract violations. 

</div>
</aside>


Prior to purchasing a solution/service that will need to integrate with Zoovy technology, BPP clients are expected to notify Zoovy of their intent to purchase the software or service and request a "provisional compatibility check".<br>
You will provide a technical contact for the company, as well as a sales contact, and any other relevant details such as what specific service you are purchasing and *especially* integration documentation. <br>
<br>

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
Many times your introduction of a new company/technology is the first step towards having them be a trusted configuration with even BETTER integration and free support! So it not only improves your near term reliability and decreases headaches but also makes good long term business sense.

</div>
</aside>


<br>
From Zoovy's perspective it's very reasonable to say that we should have some
level of control over what does and doesn't go into your site, since it's reasonable you will expect us to fix it, if it breaks.<br>

If a merchant is within the BPP trusted configuration guidelines there are any technical issues, then we will work together to arrive at a solution.<br> 
If BPP configuration guidelines are not deviated from, then any technical issue/resolutions for issues stemming from those deviations will be considered billable.

<br>

Zoovy will have our staff evaluate the technology to ensure it can be integrated prior to purchase, and provide an estimate of any costs associated with the integration – our goal is to complete this task within 1 week of being asked for a provisional compatibility check, but it may take longer depending on the complexity and vendor availability. 
BPP Clients agree to pay support charges for time invested in completing a compatibility check. 

<br>

Zoovy reserves the right to request members utilize an existing BPP Authorized partner if one is available prior to completing our provisional compatibility check.  

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
If Zoovy determines the service is a good fit for other clients we may contact the technology provider (or even a competing provider we find in our research) and offer to make them part of our BPP program. 

</div>

<section>
<h3>Custom Development</h3>
Zoovy offers software development services to BPP clients.  BPP Members agree to give Zoovy the opportunity to competitively bid on any software development work they are doing with the final option to match the price of any competitive company, provided our original quote was within 10% of the selected provider. 
</section>

<section>
<h3>Professional Conduct</h3>
BPP members are required to conduct themselves professionally when dealing with Zoovy technical support. 

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
If a BPP member does not feel a situation is being handled correctly, or they were not treated professionally they should request an immediate escalation to the customer service manager, or sales manager (depending on the specific issue).  

</div>
</aside>


</section>

<h3>Quarterly Reviews</h3>
BPP members are eligible to participate in the Quarterly reviews. During this time Zoovy may also spend 5-10 minutes conducting surveys and solicit the opinion on various topics which guide the development of our product and/or services we offer. Zoovy may also request you provide quotes, or even up to one reference per quarter for prospective clients. BPP members also grant Zoovy permission to use their company name and logo in promotional materials.

<h6>Flexibility is our Key to Success</h6>
<div>
As you're reading this - please keep in mind we are happy to discuss any of these items. Our goal is to be "inclusive" not "exclusive" when it comes to participation, we aren't looking for reasons to exclude a customer. When in question, the spirit of the guidelines, rather than the letter of the guidelines will be used for interpretation. Our goal is to provide the most consistent, stable, and robust e-commerce experience possible.

<h2>3rd Party Non-Integrated Software</h2>

These are companies that have offerings that our merchants find useful, but that we have no direct relationship with.

<h2>Approved Software Criteria</h2>

BPP Customers may request integration with additional software vendors as part of their quarterly review.

<br>

The following criteria will be applied to the vendor to determine inclusion: 
<ul>
<li> Is the technology offered by the vendor provide a clear business case for implementation.
<li> Is the vendor and their technology the leader in their space?
<li> Is a vendor who offers similar/competitive technology to Zoovy or an already established partner in the BPP program?
<li> Will the vendor be able to offer escalated Support for Zoovy customers in order to fulfill our company demands. 
</ul>

<article>
<h2>Provisional Services (HIGH RISK)</h2>

The following services/applications are not support by Zoovy, but are generally known to work under certain (undocumented) circumstances. <br>
<br>

In the future (based on client feedback during BPP meetings) Zoovy may formalize relationships with these companies, or select alternative companies, or possibly even build it's own compatible software if compatibility cannot be established.
<br>
<br>

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
We do not recommend businesses utilize provisional applications unless absolutely necessary - in the future you may be asked to change providers or software applications as the compatibility status changes. Companies who are going through an integration or pilot will often appear on this list. 

</div>
</aside>


<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>
Provisional Support is considered a high risk endeavor.

<br>
<br>

Zoovy does not monitor the quality, security or compatibility of these applications. In order to be on the provisional list, an application only needs to work on one site - or even be in the process of being deployed on only one site.  No extensive technical review has been done.

<br>
<br>

If a provisional application breaks your site, you will be liable for support charges.  Integrating these applications does not exclude a business from the BPP site appearance requirements.
