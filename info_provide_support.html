<h2>Support Overview</h2>

Provide Support is now considered a "supported application" for members of the Best Partner Practice program and Zoovy support will begin offering integration support for the application immediately.

For those merchants who are switching to ProvideSupport from LiveChat, Inc., we would like to hear your feedback on your experience with this application.  Please email billing@zoovy.com with any feedback you have.

Once you have created an account with ProvideSupport, please create a support ticket so that we can integrate the chat button into your wrapper.  The cost for this integration is based on our hourly design rate of $120/hr.  Please provide the following information in your support ticket:<br>
<br>
<li> the chat button code (it is recommended you paste the code in a Notepad text file and attach it to your Provide Support Implementation ticket.) 
<li> your login information for ProvideSupport
<li> which profile in your Zoovy account you would like us to implement this feature on
