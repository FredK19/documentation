<h1>Project: Configuring Intermediate Shipping</h1>

<article>
<h2>Concept Overview</h2>


This should always be done after Basic Zoovy Orientation and after the customer has added at least a handful of products and configured their website.

Intended for people who have more complicated shipping which will be handled by the system, and/or which may require a custom shipping API. 

Multiple shipping methods (which can be selected based on rules), special handling fees, or shipping insurance.

<h3>Fixed vs. Calculated</h3>

Calculated rates mean determining the package shipping cost based on the weight and destination (zone) that the item is being shipped to.

Due to API restrictions neither UPS and/or FedEx rates may NOT be displayed alongside any other rates. However it is possible (although not easy) using rules to determine which method will be displayed based on destination, for example: UPS Ground to the contiguous 48 states, and USPS priority to Alaska and Hawaii is a very common configuration.
