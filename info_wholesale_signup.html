<br><li>Automatically lock the new customer account.
<li>Setting information fields to require and ignore.
<li>Initial wholesale schedule for new customers.
<li>Email notification and To Do list reminders.
<li>CRM ticket creation.

<h3>Automatically locking the new customer account:</h3>
<br>
Once the customer completes sign-up, a customer account will be created for them. This account can be automatically locked until you review the account. This means that, although the account exists, the customer cannot use it yet. <br> You can unlock the account by de-selecting the 'Lock' check-box in the top section of the customer editor. To get to the customer editor, go to the Utilities Tab > Customer Manager > find your customer)

<h3>Setting information fields to Require and Ignore:</h3>
The sign-up form has a box marked 'JSON Form Fields' that allows you to customize your Wholesale form. In this box, you can limit the fields that your customers are presented on the form using the Ignore function, or prevent a customer from submitting a form without completing a specific field using the Require function. <br>Note: you may wish to call customer support for help editing this code if you are not 100% certain that you understand the directions below.<br>
<br>
<b>Ignore:</b><br> Each line representing a field on the form begins with the code "ignore":1, or "ignore":0. If the code is "ignore":1, then the field that line represents will not be shown on the form. If the code is "ignore":0, then the field will be shown.<br> 
<br>
<b>Require:</b><br>After the Ignore code, the next code is the Require code. This code works the same way, so that "required":1 will force customers to complete the field and "required":0 will not. 
Therefore, a line that begins:<br>"ignore":0,"required":1,"id":"resaleid"<br>Will make the Resale ID field appear as a required field.
