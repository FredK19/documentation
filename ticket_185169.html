Issue: How do I have Zoovy host the product pages for my OfficeLive site?

<br>

 In the video about adding the "Add to Cart" buttons, it is explained that for merchants who have more than 20 items adding the HTML for each product could become very tedious and at the time the video was created, the only option we had was to contact our business development team. 

Since the time of the video, we have made it possible for you to upgrade the account on your own. If you go into Setup look to the right hand column and click "Add/Remove Features".  At the top of the next screen you will see the "site hosting" package. This enables Zoovy to host product pages for you. These product pages would be similar in appearance to your cart page. 

Your OfficeLive site will in essence  become nothing more than a Splash Page/Landing Page to bring people to your Zoovy Product pages. You will want to create hyperlinks to those product pages on the Microsoft site. These links should be category specific.
