<h1>Concept: Lists</h1>
<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>

Lists provide an alternate way to group products outside of the navigation category structure. 
Lists do not appear in default site navigation, they must be referenced by a product list. 
Lists should be used when you need to group products by properties that are not necessarily helpful for navigation.

<div>

NOTE: Lists can be created by any customer. 
BUT only customers who have the "Cross Selling" bundle associated with their account can use them.
(Legacy 1.0 accounts can use them to submit to marketplaces, but not in website designs)

<h2>Examples of Lists</h2>

Lists are ideal for the following applications:
<li> Best Sellers
<li> Related Upsell Items
<li> Publishing Specific Items to a CPC Marketplace

<h2>Configuring</h2>

To configure a list simply go to the website and create a navigation category. 
At the bottom of the categories you will see the option to create a list. 
You will need to choose a unique name for your list, but the name is for internal use only - it is not displayed to customers.

Once you have created a list you will need to edit the product list on a webpage and reference the list. 
Zoovy has recently introduced new page layouts that include multiple product lists, so to find one you will need to select a different layout.

Lists have more utility than just putting products onto a page. 
You can also use lists to publish specific items to marketplaces such as BizRate, Shopping.com, and Yahoo Shopping.
Lists appear adjacent to categories when you are configuring your feed and configure the list to be transmitted. 
For example certain items may have larger margins and therefore may be better suited to be transmitted to a CPC (Cost Per Click) marketplace.
You can just place those products onto a special list, and associate that list with the marketplace.

<h2>Notes</h2>

<li> At this time lists cannot be created in Product Manager, they can however be managed by product manager. 
We expect this to be implemented in a future version.
<li> Products that appear in a list, but not in a navigation category will still appear when a customer searches your site.
<li> Lists can be imported and exported with navigation categories. The syntax is identical, however lists are denoted by a safe name that being with a $.
