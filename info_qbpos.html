<h1>QuickBooks Point of Sale (QBPOS)</h1>

<h3>Compatibility Statement</h3>


Zoovy does not provide an interface to the Quickbooks Point of Sale platform.
At this time no such integration is planned. There are a variety of reasons for this which are outlined below. 

<br>

The QBPOS system was acquired by Intuit as an acquisition, it was not developed in-house. While efforts have been taken to make it look and feel similar, there are still numerous incompatibilities between the two applications (even though both are made by Intuit). These incompatibilities such as pricing schedules, product options, Gift card, coupons, CRM data, cost tracking, employee monitoring, etc. become even more complicated when a 3rd application (Zoovy) is thrown into the mix.

<h2>Reasons/Business Logic</h2>

<section>
<h3>Reason #1: Data Integration</h3>
The data integration specifically surrounding pricing schedules and product options would have to be significantly "dumbed down" to be compatible with qbPOS.  This leads to significant sales challenges where customers inadvertantely assume that all the great features of Zoovy are 1:1 compatible with qbPOS. (Whereas for the most part we try to maintain complete feature parity/transparent integration with Quickbooks).

<section>
<h3>Reason #2: Marketshare</h3>
While Quickbooks commands and impressive lead in the SMB account spacing, qbPOS has less than a 1% marketshare. Furthermore after numerous discussions with Intuit no marketing effort would be made on their end to reach out to existing qbPOS installations. This made any sort of marketing effort extremely cost prohibitive. 

<br>

Unfortunately because of this there is not simply enough demand to justify either the initial or ongoing costs for developing and the subsequently providing the necessary ongoing development support (for new Intuit releases), in addition to training both Zoovy customer, technical support and sales staff on what the integration would/could/can do. 

<br>

Note: less features makes it less interesting to prospective customers, more features makes it cost prohibitive.

<h3>Reason #3: The Future of POS</h3>
We believe the future of POS will remain on the desktop, however it will need to be able to adapt and incorporate new business models. 
It will need to have an integrated customer service module, gift card processing, and employee "role" management. 
It will need to adapt to new inventory models such as self or self-assisted checkout, and new technologies such as RFID.

<h2>What we're doing about it.</h2>

We have been in research, planning, and early development stages of a Point of Sale platform for almost 3 years. The application was put on haitus while we decided to migrate both of our desktop applications to the .Net platform before creating any new applications. (The .Net migration of all applications was finished 9/15/06). 

<br>
In Q1 2007 merchants should expect to see a reasonably priced, fully integrated Zoovy Point of Sale interface which delivers a completely unified retail/web experience to buyers.  

<br>
The Zoovy Point of Sale platform was developed around the concept that there are a growing number of "web based companies" who also happen to operate a retail store. This is the exact opposite of traditional "brick and mortar" who also happens to have a website.

<br>

This contrarian approach to retail walk up will all companies to achieve powerful syngeristic benefits by combining their Retail/Walk Up, Mail Order / Telephone Order and Web Based sales channels to maximize sales and dramatically increase customer loyalty.

<br>


(In english: our gift cards will work everywhere, and have a unified balance, rewards program points will be synchronized, inventory reserves and custom customer pricing schedules will be unified, customers will be able to lookup order history online, and write website reviews from things they purchased in the store!)
