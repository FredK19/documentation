<h2>Supply Chain Order Processing</h2>

This document will give you some tips on how to use the Supply Chain feature to best accomodate your business.

<h2>Supply Chain Orders</h2>
Supply Chain orders are dispatched to your supplier when they are marked as PAID in your orders database. The order will then appear in Utilities > Supply Chain Management > "Supplier" > "Supplier" Orders.

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>Every supplier has a special orders section under Utilities > Supply Chain Management. This is where orders assigned to that specific supplier will appear.
</div>

<br>
There are two sections on the supplier's orders screen:
<section>
<h3>New Items to be Ordered for Supplier</h3>
This is where a new order for the supplier will first appear. This means the order is queued up to be dispatched.
</section>
<section>
<h3>Orders Created for Supplier</h3>
Once an order is actually dispatched to your supplier it will appear on this list.

<h2>Non-confirmed Orders</h2>
Under Utilities > Supply Chain Management, before you click on a Supplier, at the top you will see a tab for Non-confirmed Orders. The Non-confirmed Orders screen can assist you in organizing and keeping track of the orders that our system could not verify as shipped.
<br>
<section>
<h3>How do I confirm an order?</h3>
This feature is used with dropship supply chain. A link will appear at the bottom of the dropship supply chain order email that your supplier receives. Your supplier can click on that link to enter tracking information which will come back into Zoovy and confirm for you that the order has been shipped.
<br>
If your supplier cannot or will not confirm orders for you, you can confirm supply chain orders that have been shipped manually by clicking on the link under the Confirmed column (which will in all likelihood say "NEVER" at this point). You will see a field to enter a tracking number to confirm the order and remove it from this screen. We suggest you do this as part of your regular supply chain order processing to keep track of orders that you need to follow up on.
</section>
<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>You can check box multiple orders and use the radio buttons at the bottom of the screen in order to confirm multiple orders that you simply want to clear from the Non-confirmed Orders screen.
