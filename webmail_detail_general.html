<h2>How does ZoovyMail handle Spam?</h2>


Spam is not only a nuisance, but it is also a counter productive entity 
that can drain the production of your employees and make Email Communications
nearly unbearable. At FuseMail we have several techniques in place that 
virtually put an end to spam some of these techniques include Challenge 
Response technology and Bayesian spam filtering.

<h2>How Does FuseMail handle Viruses?</h2>


All messages sent and received via e-mail are scanned and monitored by the 
FuseScan Virus Engine, in real time, for spam mail and viruses before ever 
reaching the Email Network preventing any damage to the data contained in your 
Email Message or our systems. The FuseScan Anti Virus Engine scans various 
compressed file formats including ZIP, ARJ (JAR), LZH (LHA), RAR, and ACE.

<h2>How can I administer my account?</h2>



Administering your Email accounts has never been easier with our comprehensive, 
web-based, FuseAdmin. Our power administration area allows you to configure 
every aspect of your Email account. Some of the features of FuseAdmin include 
Adding users, changing userï¿½s passwords, creating forwarders, 
creating aliases, allocation and viewing of disk quotas.<br>
<br>

The FuseAdmin account is always admin@YOURNAME.zoovy.com, and the password is 
displayed in the domain setup area when you are logged into Zoovy as the administrative
user for your account.

HINT: use the fusemail admin account to setup shared folders for mail aliases such
as support, returns, etc. As employees come and go from your company it is easy to give
them access. The admin account can not be deleted, so it ensures that an employee leaving
and having their account terminated will NOT affect the delivery of mail to those aliases.

The standard diskspace for fusemail accounts is 250mb. If you need more space, open a support ticket and let us know. We can increase this up to 1gb for you at no additional charge, you need only request it.

Additional space, up to 2gb, 3gb, 4gb, requires customer service manager approval. Open a support ticket for these requests also.

At this time, there is no additional charge for more space, however in the future if it becomes necessary that we charge for this service, it will be announced on the recent news and you will be automatically billed.
