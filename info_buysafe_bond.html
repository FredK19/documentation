Some of the buySAFE branding images are very wide.  Putting this html into your sidebar will likely break the aesthetic of your store.  It is recommended that you choose one of the more narrow seals to avoid this.

Only the premium seal code will work in conjunction with the sidebar feature.

<h2>To be fully Buysafe compliant</h2>
To be fully compliant with Buysafe you need to	be using a newer email template (specifically one with order contents formatted by a CART element) so it can include the buysafe line item content, footer message, a buysafe line after the tax and a buysafe bond in the total.  

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div> All templates designed since Jan 1st. 2007 are compliant.

<h2>Buysafe and Partitions</h2>
When enabling Buysafe bonding, the selected configuration will be applied to all sites on a specified Partition.  Either all, or none, of the sites on a Partition will be Buysafe bonded.  <br>
Sites on the same Partition cannot be set independently in regarding this feature.

<h2>To be fully Buysafe compliant</h2>

I wanted to know if the BuySAFE + Truste seal is acceptable for BBP members?  I
also wanted to know if the Truste seal is worth $30 per month?
<br>

The straight answer is: we don't know. 

<br>

This is a new offering by buysafe - we haven't had a chance to play with it. Not sure if there is any integration work we would need to do - we will follow up and ask Buysafe if you want to move forward with this.

<br>

Since it is a service offered through BuySafe we would make a best effort to make it work, but it wasn't something on our development roadmap (which we're a bit behind on) so it wouldn't necessarily be implemented right away - if any changes on our end are required.

<br>

As far as the "does it work question" -- We can arrange an A/B test on this to see if it has any impact on sales.  Our best guess is that at lower sales volumes it won't have a positive ROI and at higher ones it will.  Buysafe does a good job of conversions on it's own, having multiple trust symbols after the first one has diminishing returns.  In addition other factors like slower site performance may offset any increased conversions.

<h2>How do buyers cancel Buysafe bonds?</h2>

Before the buyer checks out they can uncheck the box in the cart.  Or after the sale BuySafe sends the buyer an email which includes a link to cancel the bond.
