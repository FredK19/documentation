<h2>Log Sent Email</h2>

This tool is used to determine problems with sending email through Order Manager.  If you are asked to log sent email, you will select this option from the admin menu under technical support.  This will create a file that you will then need to attach to your tech support ticket so the technicians can diagnose what is happening with any email sending problems you may be having. This is typically related to SMTP settings.  For more on SMTP settings and errors, please select the troubleshooting area of the menu.

<h2>Multiple Copies</h2>

Running multiple copies of order manager is not supported unless you have an Enterprise account at this time.  Doing so can cause problems with syncing and unintended changes to order status.
