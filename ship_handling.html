Handling fees are applied to all shipping methods after the rules based shipping calculation. Handling fees are typically used to cover the packaging expenses and/or labor involved in assembling an order. You may enable as many handling calculations as you like, all methods will be summed together to arrive at the final handling total.

<h2>Requirements</h2>
You must have the Shipping Bundle on your account to use this feature.  You can add this bundle by going to Setup >> Add/Remove Features. <br>

The "Shipping Bundle" includes:<br>

<li> Customer Pickup Shipping Method - allow customers in select zip codes to choose a local pickup.
<li> Local Delivery Shipping Method - allow customers in select zip codes to opt for local delivery.
<li> Shipping Rules - delivers the ability to fine tune shipping rates in a variety of ways using selective matching on products, zip codes, countries and more.
<li> Handling Fees - create special handling fees which apply to all shipping methods.
<li> Insurance Fees - allow customers to choose insurance, or make it mandatory for all orders. Insurance can be computed based on a flat per item fee, by the total price of the order, by the total weight of the order, or on a per product basis - ultimately you can also modify the final insurance result using shipping rules.
