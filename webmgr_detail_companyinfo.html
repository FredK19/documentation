<h1>Company Information and Policies</h1>

<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>
In order for a store to operate properly it must have valid contact information. Zoovy automatically correlates your contact information and places it through out the store, auctions and emails  so that your customers can easily reach you in the event they need to get a hold of you.  As a reputable business, it is your responsibility to provide contact information when requested so that information can be shared with customers.

It is important to remember that if you edit your company information in one place in the Zoovy interface, it will effect other areas of your store.

<h2>For Customers</h2>
<b>Who sees my Contact information?</b><br>
As a reputable business, it is your responsibility to provide contact information when requested so
that information can be shared with customers. Zoovy will strategically place your contact information throughout your
website so that your customers will be able to easily reach you in the event they need to get ahold of you.<br>
<br>
<b>What is Website Contact Email and Contact Phone?</b><br>
The website contact email and website contact phone should probably be linked to your personal
email address, or a phone which is not generally accessible to the public. In the event that Zoovy needs to contact
you regarding your website, the contact email and contact phone will be used. This information will NEVER be disclosed
to the customers.

<h2>For Zoovy</h2>
Zoovy supports two email addresses, one for notifications such as newsletters, announcements, etc. from Zoovy and one for customer support. The account email may be setup in the account configuration -in the setup area, and the support email the one given to your customers may be setup in the Website configuration -in the setup area. If the support email doesn't exist then the account email is used, if the account email is blank then the support email will be used. There will be a slight performance penalty since the Zoovy system will need to do two lookups instead of one, so we recommend setting both fields even if they are both the same.

<div>The email address that you set inside Company Information for your Default profile is also the email address that the "Contact Us" webpage form from your website will be sent to.  In order to change where these emails are sent, change this address.
