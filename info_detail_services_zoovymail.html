<h1>Zoovy Mail Hosting / Transport service</h1>
<article>
<h2>Zoovy Mail Hosting</h2>
 
<p>Zoovy does not provide its customers with email accounts by default. We feel 
  this is the responsibility of the customers Internet Service Provider. Zoovy 
  does provide domain redirection services which provide email forwarding if you 
  own a customer domain name. In addition, you may purchase a Zoovymail account 
  to add your existing Zoovy bundle.

  Zoovy offers mail accounts as an added feature to a Zoovy account. The standard package is 5 emails accounts linked to a domain hosted by Zoovy. Each mail box having 
250 megs of storage space for the mail.

<h2>Autoresponders</h2>

  Autoresponders can be configured with an email or hosting account. You must 
  provide the mailbox name e.g. info@yourdomain.com, along with the message.<br>
  The autoresponder responds to all inbound messages, except those from 
  other auto-responders. Up to 5 addresses with different auto-responders are 
  available. With ZoovyMail service, you can have unlimited emails - up to 20mb 
  of disk space.

<h2>Mail Filtering</h2>

  By default Zoovy uses Spamcop and ORDB to filter our mail. If you are using
  a Zoovymail account, there is additional filtering taking place.<br>
  <br>
  Here are the filters currently, on ZoovyMail accounts.<br>
  <br>
  scr, pif, exe, 386, app, bin, btm, com, cab, cbt, cgi, chm, cmd, crt, cvp, dll, 
  dot, drv, fon, fxp, hlp, isp, jar, jse, ksh, lib, lnk, mp3, nte, nws, obj, ocx, 
  ops, pgm, pot, pps, prg, reg, slb, smm, sys, url, vir, vbs, vmx, vxd, xms<br>
  <br>
  These are the extensions that are blocked to and from ZoovyMail, they are NOT 
  account customizable, this is for every account. If a zip file comes in with 
  a name like this it is also blocked:<br>
  <br>
  your_document|approved|thank_you|details|wicked|your_details|application|document|screensaver|movie)\.zip<br>
  <br>
  Blank Subject lines are blocked as SPAM. Improperly created TO lines in mail 
  will be blocked. Spammers try to hide their mail routes and return addresses.<br>
  <br>
  If mail is blocked for any of these reasons, ZoovyMail will bounce the message 
  with a very specific error message as to why it bounced.
