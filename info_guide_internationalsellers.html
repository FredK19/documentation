<h1>International Support for Non-US based businesses</h1>
<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>

Zoovy does not currently provide full services for non-US based businesses. 
We continue to see limited demand in that area, and now accept International clients who agree to specific provisions.  Zoovy may NEVER add International support, both the upfront and ongoing costs of Internationalizing a product as robust as Zoovy is substantial, it also hampers future development thereby making our current customer base less competitive.

<br>

Non-US based businesses should be aware of the limitations described within this document.

<h2>Currency</h2>

At this time Zoovy only supports US Dollars as currency as a standard feature.  
However limited deployment of displaying foreign currency rates is now available, and is available on a limited basis (requires custom product, category & cart pages). 

<br>

Within the Zoovy platform all computations are done in dollars. (This is important because other currencies have different rounding requirements).

<h2>International Language</h2>

However the ability to create alternate language websites using Zoovy is currently in testing. Most of the messages in the system are now user-definable, and we have the ability to let shoppers output languages as an experimental feature.

<h2>International Taxes</h2>

Zoovy does not offer the ability to calculate International taxes such as VAT's or unique rounding situations that often arise in International business.   All internal computations are done in US dollars.

<h2>Shipping</h2>

By default Zoovy assumes all shipping is originating from the US.
We have built in rate support for Canada post using a Shipping API.
International origin rates could be calculated using a Shipping API. 

<br>

Zoovy also integrates with a variety of fulfillment centers in the United States where International businesses can ship their products by the container and then have them shipped directly to US buyers. 

<br>

Zoovy will not generate non-US origin airbills. We may not support integration with other 3rd party shipping applications.

<h2>Support &amp; Implementation</h2>

The Zoovy user interface and technical support is provided exclusively in English. 
International customers who wish to interact with Zoovy support must supply a US phone number (e.g. Skype or Vonage) and have English speaking staff.
