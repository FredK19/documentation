Shopping.com: http://merchantsupport.shopping.com/docs/feed_guide  (i.e Home and Garden->Kitchen->Tableware). 

4/11/11-
There are some 3rd tier subcategories listed on shopping.com that are not available within the data feed. (i.e Home and Garden->Kitchen->Tableware). These sub categories are selected by a Shopping.com rep based on the product name or, if necessary, product description. Because products are placed based primarily on product name or description, mapping under syndication does not ensure the product will be placed in that category. 
 
[[/STAFF]]

Registered Shopping.com Merchants can submit products to Shopping.com, the largest online shopping search engine. If you have not enrolled in the Shopping.com Merchant Program to go to www.shopping.com<br>
<br>
Shopping.com reaches more than 10 million likely buyers every month through www.dealtime.com and through alliances with major portals and search engines including AltaVista, EarthLink and Lycos. With our cost-per-click model and our online CPC management tool we can be your most effective and efficient sales driver.
<br>
Before you can use Shopping.com you must first register with Shopping.com. 
In order to register you must fill out a form online, and then be called back to verify your authenticity 
as a merchant and the types of items you will sell.

[[/SECTION]]
[[CAUTION]]
Shopping.com does not check inventory, therefore any products sent up in the feed that are out of stock will not be taken down from Shopping.com.  To remove these products from the feed please set the shopping:ts to -1.
[[/CAUTION]]

[[SECTION]BENEFITS]

Here are some of the key benefits of Shopping.com:<br>
<li> A strong click-to-sale ratio.  With the launch of tax and shipping information throughout our site, our clients have seen a steady climb in sales conversions.
<li> The largest ready-to-buy shopping audience on the Internet.
<li> Far reaching exposure through major search engines and portals including EarthLink, Excite, and ATT.net, to name a few.
<br>
<Br>
With Shopping.com there are no set-up fees so you only pre-pay for the traffic that we send you.

[[SECTION]Getting Started]

As part of the sign up process you will be asked to create a Shopping.com username and password.

<br>

<br>

[[CBC]How to set up your automatic feed:]

<li> Tell us about your feed file.  Select 'I have a feed file only'<br>
<li> Write down the following information for your records.<br>
<li> 'Print for your records' is highly recommended since getting back to this section will require a reset of the previous steps.<br>
<li> In a separate window/tab login to Zoovy.com, go to: Setup >> Syndication >> Shopping.com and select the desired Profile's EDIT link.<br>
<li> Enter the FTP location (ftp.shopping.com), username and password into the spaces provided.<br>
<li> Go back to the window/tab where we left off on step #2<br>
