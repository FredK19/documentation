<div> You can only select one logo at a time. Meaning you can't select multiple logos at once and move them from the available to selected logos list in one move. You will have to move them one at a time. In addition you can use the move up or move down button to the right to determine the order of how the logos will appear. In addition, if you would like to remove a selected logo simply select the logo under the list of selected logos and use the left arrow. It will move the selected logo back under the available logo section. Always remember to click SAVE after completing your changes or modifications.
