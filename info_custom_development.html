<h1>Custom Development: Getting Started</h1>






<article>
<h2>Concept Overview</h2>

This document describes how to get features added to the Zoovy platform.  In addition this document contains the Zoovy policy regarding "scoping fees".

<br>

Specific details about the different kinds of development, and the warranty of work following development is discussed in:

<h2>Getting a quote</h2>

The best way to get started with a development project is to discuss it during a BPP meeting.  During a BPP meeting our staff will be able to assist you in developing the business case, and identifying upcoming features and partnerships already in development which may alleviate the need for your project. 

<br>

If you do not have a request, you may also start your project by starting an electronic support ticket.  We request that clients include a brief description of the functionality they would like, along with a business case (how it will be used, or why the functionality is useful), along with the budget for the project.   The minimum budget for a project is $500.

<div>
Without a budget and a business case, your request will not be considered.

Once our development team has had the opportunity to briefly review the request, then we will provide a ballpark estimate.   Provided the ballpark estimate is acceptable to the client, then the project moves into the "Scoping" stage which is discussed below.

<h2>Scoping Fees</h2>

Zoovy charges a $500 scoping fee per project.
With any development project determining specific client needs, analyzing client interfaces, and accurately calculating the development cost for any project is the most difficult part.  When done correctly scoping typically consumes 40% to 60% of the time involved in implementing the actual project.  When the initial scope of a project is not done correctly it results in costly mid project changes often causing significant budget and time overruns, and ultimately in many circumstances: failure to achieve business objectives. 

<br>
  
Clients are understandably reticent to commit to projects without knowing the specific costs.  To solve this Zoovy provides clients with a free Ballpark estimate based on their high level description of the project, taking into account "likely" customer requirements and anticipated difficulties and time involved in generating the quote.   Upon acceptance of the ballpark estimate  Zoovy will submit a contract for general service to the account, and request the client agree to a $500 a one time non-reoccurring scope fee for each unique project. 

<br>

Zoovy will then assign a developer and project manager to sit down and engage the client in project specifics and create a development plan including documenting any algorithms, and establish project milestones which is then presented to the client with a final cost, along with any ongoing maintenance costs.  Ultimately creating a detailed project plan that could be used by any developer to implement the project. 

<br>
In the event the final cost exceeds the initial ballpark estimate – the client is refunded half of the $500 scoping fee.
<br>

In the event the ball park estimate is the same or higher than the final project price the client may use the $500 scope fee as a deposit on the project within the next 3 months.


<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
Please remember: ballpark estimates are almost always higher than the actual project costs because they take into account "worst case" scenarios with regard to functionality requirements.  By the time the project plan is done, Zoovy is in many cases more than 60% done with the project – so it is in our best interest to come in as low as possible in order to get a green light on finishing the project.  We recommend clients proceed with a scoping fee on the understanding the quote may come back as high as the ballpark estimate.

Getting a lower quote: Automation is expensive, but has a lower long term operating cost. During the scoping process bi-directional discussions of possibilities for managing short term, and long term project costs are absolutely encouraged! Zoovy is committed to delivering a project that no only meets the functionality and time-frame constraints, but also budget constraints!

<h2>Non-Supported Third Party Vendors</h2>


Clients will occasionally request integration with non-supported third party systems. Any vendor which is not on the BPP Approved vendor list is considered by Zoovy to be a non-supported vendor.  

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
Participants in the BPP program will need to request a waiver or risk being removed from the BPP program.   The BPP discounts are provided to clients based on a specific support profile of known working systems. In many cases non-supported third party systems will put clients outside of the support profile.  

</div>
</aside>


All projects with non-supported third party systems are given a reasonable time allotment to facilitate interaction via emails and phone calls.  However unexpected delays, or scope changes caused by a vendor, or by Client during a project will result in budget overruns, or projects missing their deadlines.  Zoovy will endeavor to notify Client as this is happening.  Once approved all projects with third party vendors are non-refundable, in the event of cost-overruns the Client may choose to either approve the project, or cancel the project at anytime. 

<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>
Picking the right vendor is paramount to the success of a project!  
Clients with vendors who are unable to provide or clarify documentation within a timely manner may find their project put on hold and lose their priority.  Along with incurring additional expenses due to the rescheduling, the project can also be delayed by weeks or even months by choosing the wrong vendor!

</div>
</aside>


<br>

The Client is responsible for selecting a vendor who will be able to deliver a working product. Prior to the scope meeting Zoovy recommends that Client requests Vendor supply all required information including but not limited to: documentation, user logins, program code samples, IP addresses, data samples, or actual data files prior to the scope meeting.

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
To meet the needs of demanding clients, Zoovy has adopted a zero tolerance policy with regard to non-supported third party vendors who delay projects. Prior to this policy "bad vendors" routinely caused delays with in other projects with "good vendors".

<h2>Why Projects are Rejected</h2>

Zoovy routinely turns down new features when we feel they are not in the best interest of the platform, and they cannot be implemented as a standalone feature exclusively for a website. 

<br>

Contrary to popular belief - not every feature is a good feature. More complex software means both increased new client boarding, in addition to ongoing support costs, delays in issue resolution, and attrition of less sophisticated clients who may opt for “simpler” software.  Any future changes to the platform need to be regression tested against previously developed features to ensure compatibility. 

<br>

Features which add unnecessary complexity to the user interface have a long term cost to train employees, and future customers.   In many cases features have non-obvious unforeseen dependencies on other features which may not be uncovered for months or even years until it impacts a business in a negative way and is reported as a bug – with the expectation that it will be fixed for free in a timely manner.   Intensive operations combined with larger data sets means slower servers – requiring additional resources. 

<br>

Unfortunately it is not possible to create a separate version of the Zoovy platform for only one client that has a feature specific to only that client. The long term costs associated of determining how required updates by vendors such as eBay, FedEx, UPS, Amazon, etc. would quickly overshadow any short term savings.  It would be impossible to coordinate updates to what would potentially be hundreds of different versions of the software in a timely manner.   Zoovy on average applies 12.5 updates every day to our software – although the vast majority of those are unannounced because they affect fewer than 100 clients, each change would need to be tested against each version adding substantial expense to maintain separate (individual) versions for each client who wanted their own custom feature.
