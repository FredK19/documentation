<h2>URL Rewrite Rules</h2>
A rewrite rule allows you to redirect traffic from one url to another url on your site, or another site. For example if you want to run a promotion at http://www.yourdomain.com/promo you would direct /promo to a category page such as "/category/promotion".
<br>
This feature is useful when creating print, radio, or television campaigns. The URL rewrite rules can also be useful when migrating from another webhost to Zoovy and you want to retain pages which are indexed by Google or other search engines.
<br>

<div>Rewrites can also be set through CSV.  When creating rewrites for a category page the incoming URL must end in (/).  Also when redirecting to a different domain the full URL is needed and can ONLY be done by csv.<br>
ex. Incoming URL (%PATH): www.mydomain.com  Rewrite To (%TARGETURL): http://www.differentdomain.com <br>
For product urls, if you have a large number of rewrites but do not know the replacing url for each, the attribute %KEYWORDS can be used in place of %TARGETURL. On the %KEYWORDS column, enter any correlating keywords for that product url. The system will rewrite according to the follow rules: <br>
<li>If one match is found, the url will rewrite to that product url
<li>Multiple matches for those keywords, the url will rewrite to a search result
<li>No matches, the url will rewrite to the homepage
