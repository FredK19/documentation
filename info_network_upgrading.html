<h2>dot net framework error</h2>

When upgrading from version 7.056 to version 8.0x or higher you will encounter the following error when trying to install and connect an Enterprise Order Manager, and Sync Manager client to the mysql database for the first time:

************** Exception Text **************<br>
System.ArgumentException: Unable to find the requested .Net Framework Data
Provider.  It may not be installed.<br>
   at System.Data.Common.DbProviderFactories.GetFactory(String
providerInvariantName)
   at Zoovy.Common.Auth.ZAuth.OpenCnnDB()<br>
   at Zoovy.Common.Auth.frmLogin.DBLogin()<br>
......(con't)
<br>
<br>

The error is resolved by downloading and installing a connection component from MySql.  The component can be found by following the link below: <br>

<a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/net/5.2.html"  >mysql-connector-net-5.2.5.exe</a>. Choose the Windows Binaries Download.<br>

Simple click the link and then click on "No thanks, just take me to the downloads!".  Choose any mirror site and "HTTP".  Running this on your machine will resolve the connection issue and allow EZOM client to reach the database.
<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
You must uninstall any previous version of the connector that is not 5.2.5 before you download the new one. If you do not then it will not allow you to download it.
