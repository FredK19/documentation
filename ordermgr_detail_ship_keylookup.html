<h1>Keyed Lookup Feature in Order Manager</h1>
<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>


The Keyed Lookup Mode is intended for use by customers who print out their invoices or 
packing slips in order manager, then pick the items, and who want to avoid the extra step of finding the invoice to print out the shipping label.  If you are shipping more than 50 packages a day or have more than one person handling shipping, please consider using this feature.  It saves time and reduces the risk that an order might shipped when the order has been canceled, fulfilled by another employee, or not marked paid. 
<br>
<br>
In Keyed Lookup Mode when you enter a fully qualified order # (e.g. 2004-10-1234), via the keyboard or more commonly by using a barcode scanner connected to the shipping pc, the order pops up in order manager and defaults to the carrier in the order. 
<br>
<br>
By default the invoices and packing slips printed by Zoovy automatically contain a industry standard "3 of 9" barcode 
at the bottom which can be scanned by virtually any PS2 or USB Barcode scanner.
<br>
<br>
You must have at least one of the following configured in ZID to use this feature: UPS, FedEx, USPS via Endicia Dazzle.
<br>
<br>
Keyed Lookup Mode simply saves the extra step of re-finding the order # in order manager if you already have the invoice
or packing slip in front of you and helps to prevent duplicate shipments. If you ship a couple dozen of packages a day it might not be worth investing in a barcode scanner, but if you ship many packages a day this is a huge time saver.<br>
<br>
<br>
To enable keyed lookup mode simply go to Tools on the menu bar and select "Keyed Lookup".

it is common practice for UPS to provide barcode scanners 
along with free personal computers and label printers along with labels for shipping (even ground).

<div>Universal Keyed Lookup is commonly used along with "Require Package Verification." This is a setting in Zoovy >> Setup >> Manage Users that *requires* the product UPCs of the package to be scanned before an airbill can be printed and can be configured per user.
