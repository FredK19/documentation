[[SECTION]Custom Work Overview]
The custom work process here at Zoovy follows a path that will ensure completion in a timely manner, as well as mutual satisfaction with the finished product.  We recognize that any custom work project is going to be a cooperative process, maximizing our knowledge of e-commerce, with your knowledge of your product and customer base.  The process is divided into three parts:  
[[BREAK]]
Pre-production
<li>Kick-off Meeting Preparation</li>
<li>Kick-off Meeting</li>
<li>Concept/Revision Stage</li>

[[BREAK]]
Production
<li>Construction</li>
<li>Testing</li>
<li>Deployment</li>

[[/SECTION]]



[[SECTION]Preproduction]

Prior to the kick-off meeting, we recommend you spend a little time putting together some information and preparing it for our design team. This could include a list of the following:
<ul>
	<li>Your target customer demographic</li>
	<li>your major competitors</li>
	<li>Goals for the store</li>
	<li>The desired look for you store (colors, design elements, etc.)</li>
	<li>Example sites or designs</li>
	<li>Promotions</li>
	<li>Special needs for category structure</li>
	<li>Information about your business model that could affect the design</li>
</ul>

Shortly after coming on board Zoovy, you'll have a kick-off meeting. If you are a Zoovy Complete customer, then members of the design, marketing and implementation team will all be present. This will be a scheduled call organized by your Account Manager.

[[BREAK]]

If you purchased design work only, your appointment will be with your assigned designer.  You can log in to Zoovy > support > project and reach out to them electronically, but you'll likely get a phone call before you have the chance. You can also schedule an appointment through zoovy > support > scheduler > design

[[SUBSECTION]The Kick-off Meeting]

As previously mentioned, the kick-off meeting will vary depending on the package purchased and may, in some cases, be followed up with a call by just the designer so that a more detailed (and design-centered) conversation can take place.  In general, the design aspects of the meeting will cover some of the points listed in the 'pre-meeting' section above.

[[/SUBSECTION]]

[[HINT]]
Most members of the Zoovy design staff are not implementation specialists or on the support team.  They are unlikely to be able to help you with matters not directly related to the custom design.  The ticket that is open for the custom work should be used only for the design portion of any project.
[[/HINT]]



[[SUBSECTION]The Design/Revision Stage]

After the kick-off meeting and/or any necessary follow-up phone calls, your designer will work up an initial concept based on all the information gathered.  Prior to the design being presented to you, a peer-review takes place.  This is where the design team gets together to review new concepts (development and/or marketing team members may also be present). This meeting is used to constructively critique and question the design. Typically, this meeting only takes place once per project. Feedback is provided and implemented into the concept.  The concept is then provided to you through the ticketing system, often accompanied by a description of how things are going to work.

[[BREAK]]
Most of the project pieces are sent at the same time (popup themes are not previewed), typically including the theme/homepage and an email template (used for outbound system messages, such as 'order created', not for newsletters).  The pieces of the project are dictated by the package purchased.

[[BREAK]]
The revision process (including what constitutes a revision) is covered in detail here:<br />
[[LINKDOC]51592]
[[BREAK]]

Some projects include print as well as web design work.  These projects are typically handled by different personnel and may be on different tickets.  In some cases, these projects can not commence until after the web design work is done.  This is handled on a project-by-project basis and will depend on the nature of the print work.

[[BREAK]]

Before a project can go to production, all the individual concepts must be approved. It's just more efficient for our build team to build it all at once than piece-meal.  Once all the pieces are signed off on, the project goes to the build team.

[[STAFF]]

[[SUBSECTION]The Customer's Responsibilities]

<li>Provide constructive feedback based on previews sent by designer in a reasonable time</li>
<li>Take the time needed during the preview stage to make sure you are happy with the design</li>
<li>Move forward with implementation as design work is progressing</li>
<li>Familiarize yourself with the Zoovy platform</li>
<li>Sign off on final preview for each piece to signify construction is ready to begin</li>

[[/SUBSECTION]]

[[SUBSECTION]The Designer's Responsibilities]
<li>Establish the main aesthetic design and layout for the project, with customers help</li>
<li>Provide suggestions and guidance to the best of their professional experience</li>
<li>Respond timely to customers design related questions</li>
<li>Provide revisions within 2 working days of feedback</li>
<li>Get familiar with customer's product and customer base</li>
[[/SUBSECTION]]

[[SECTION]Production Phase]
Once all the previews have been signed off on, the product phase begins.  At this point, any changes that are requested will be billable. This is done to ensure our designers work in an efficient manner, so that we can continue to keep our prices low for custom design work.

[[SUBSECTION]Construction]
The construction phase usually takes between 5 - 10 business days, depending on the type of project and the complexity. The bigger (more pieces) the project, the longer it takes to build.  If any custom programming (including Flash or AJAX) is part of the project, the duration of the contruction phase could be impacted.
[[/SUBSECTION]]

[[SUBSECTION]Testing]
We like to take our time here.  The builder is testing as the site is being built. Once it's 'ready', the designer runs their critical eye over it, making sure the appearance of the site is maintained as much as possible from the initial concept. Testing occurs in multiple browsers on multiple operating systems to ensure consistency, where practical.
[[BREAK]]
If the store is not live, the templates are usually selected to make testing easier. The designer will usually invite you to participate in providing feedback once they deem the site is, more or less, ready. Having a store/profile to select and utilize the templates on will make the testing process much more successful.
[[/SUBSECTION]]


[[SUBSECTION]Deployment]
If the store was not live during testing, then not much deployment is needed by the designer. Implementation is usually handling taking a store live. However if an existing store was getting a redesign, the deployment is usually handled in conjunction with the merchant so that the transition is as smooth as possible (imp/tech help may be enlisted as well, depending on the scope of the project).
[[/SUBSECTION]]


[[/SECTION]]

[[SECTION]Post-Production Phase (optional but recommended)]

Once your site is deployed and making sales, it is important to keep the look 'fresh' and the technology cutting edge.  The platform itself allows you to do this in some cases, however we also encourage you to check back with your designer every few months to see what new features could be deployed or to look into have graphics updated (especially important with banners).  You can do this on your original design ticket or by contacting your account manager.

[[SECTION]Coordinating with External Designers]

[[SUBSECTION]Definition]
An external designer is any person or company which develops website previews who is not an employee or contractor of Zoovy.  For example, an inside designer who works for a client or an outside advertising agency who is engaged with the client. 

[[BREAK]]

Certain clients may wish to utilize external designers to assist with the migration of their website to the Zoovy platform. The rationale for using External Designers varies but is most commonly due either to an existing internal resource, an internal business requirement, or as an attempted cost saving measure. 

[[/SUBSECTION]]

[[SUBSECTION]Fixed Price Rationale]
Zoovy's fixed pricing is based on the assumption that we are able to control certain elements of the design.  Internally our pricing assumes that there will be no more than a 20% "difference" between a new project and other projects we've done previously. This means we can recycle patterns we have already developed and tested.  This 20% "difference" is what allows our design team to consistently deliver on projects within our time-frames and fee structure.

[[HINT]]
The 20% "difference" is an internal guideline used for establishing pricing. Once a project has been agreed to at a fixed price - we will finish the job at that price, unless the customer alters the scope.  We may extend the time line of the project if is not feasible to complete on time given the complexity of the client requests. We will always endeavor to communicate this to the client as early in the process as possible. 
[[/HINT]]

[[/SUBSECTION]]

[[SUBSECTION]Mock Up vs. Functional Site]
External designers submit raster mock-ups to Zoovy which are typically done in an application such as Adobe Photoshop. These designs must then be translated by Zoovy's build team into HTML, in order to work within the content management framework inside the Zoovy platform.  It is not possible to use a Photoshop PSD file as a website. Dynamic elements such as XML, Javascript, and Flash must be added to make the site interactive and usable by a customer. 
[[/SUBSECTION]]

[[SUBSECTION]External Builders]
The builder is the person who translates the non-functional mock-up into a functional design. Zoovy's internal build team works alongside the Zoovy back-end development team to ensure that future upgrades to the Zoovy platform do not break or disable websites we've built.  Builders are also on-hand when enhancements are introduced to quickly address any issues which may arise.  For this reason, Zoovy does not support or endorse External Builders.

[[HINT]]
Enhancement rollouts will routinely occur in the middle of the night, on weekends, or holidays to minimize any potential for disruption.  Zoovy does not endorse or support external builders because the cost of coordinating these releases with External Builders would be cost prohibitive. 

[[BREAK]]

In other cases these enhancements happen on ridiculously compressed timelines (as little as a few minutes) due to unknown constraints given to Zoovy by 3rd parties such as Google, Paypal, Fedex, UPS, eBay, Amazon, etc. 
[[/HINT]]

[[HINT]]
Clients can have their own internal staff trained to be builders (zoovy programmers), if they have business situations which drive these requirements.  The cost of maintaining a full time programmer and keeping them trained is prohibitively expensive. We would never endorse or recommend using a live successful business to "teach" somebody to program in our back-end. 
[[/HINT]]

[[/SUBSECTION]]

[[SUBSECTION]Coordination Policy]
When working with an external designer the number of new unknown variables introduced into a project makes offering a fixed price project infeasible.  Our experience tells us that each one of these projects is unique, and very often the success of the project moves outside our realm of control.   In our view this effectively moves Zoovy from the "partner" category, to the "contractor" category, and rests the responsibility for success squarely on the client's shoulders. 

[[BREAK]]

The opportunity for project failure increases substantially.   If an external designer is introduced into the project, Zoovy reserves the right to convert the project into an hourly project. Zoovy will also terminate BPP incentives, at least until the project is finalized.  During the project, Zoovy staff will follow the instructions of you, or your assigned design liaison to the very best of our ability. Ultimately we still want you to be successful!

[[HINT]]
If a project is converted into an hourly project, or if a project is canceled, then the following formula for adjusting credits will be used. Each component of the project that has had time spent will be broken out separately, using retail (non-BPP) pricing from http://proshop.zoovy.com.  The following scale will be applied to determine prospective refunds for each component based on the progress:
CREATIVE STAGE: 1st preview=(30% due, 70% refund, 2nd preview=50% due, 50% refund, 3rd preview=60% due, 40% refund, 4th preview=70% due, 30% refund, 5th preview or more - full amount due, no refund. BUILD STAGE: No refund.  ** DUE amounts are calculated based on the non-BPP pricing. 
[[BREAK]]
Any credits will be applied to future invoices, any outstanding payment plans are terminated and all remaining balances become due immediately. 
[[BREAK]]
Under no circumstances will monthly minimum fees be refunded, or waived. 
Monthly minimum fees cover the cost of backups, upgrades, technical support, and assistance - they are not tied to projects.  

[[/HINT]]

[[HINT]]
The CMS Zoovy employs is extremely robust and can accept virtually any design.  Unfortunately, the amount of time and estimated cost of unknown designs, are extremely difficult to gauge.  In most cases the only way to realistically estimate the cost is to actually complete the work.  If we have sufficient information to provide an estimate, we will endeavor to - however, it is important to realize any such estimates would be non-binding, and do not represent a fixed-price agreement between all parties.
