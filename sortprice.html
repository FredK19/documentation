Regrettably we do not plan to add sortprice as an integrated feed any time in the<br> immediate future.<br>
<br>
Regardless if it is intended for not - whenever we (Zoovy) add a new marketplace it is a<br>'tactic' endorsement of the marketplace and their business tactics.   Clients <br>understandably expect us to support the marketplace, and maintain it, and feel compelled<br>to tell us about their experiences, and in most cases are upset -with Zoovy- <br>when "things don't go as planned" -- ex: I can't believe Zoovy would allow me to do this.<br>For this reason we are selective about the partners we choose to associate ourselves with.<br>
<br>
Sortprice has been in business for many years and we have been aware/tracking their<br>progress. Based on traffic numbers from various sources (such as Alexa) - Sortprice<br>has little/no traffic.  Based on feedback from other clients who have tried them - <br>they did not continue to pursue a relationship with them.   Perhaps more concerning<br>is the Sortprice recent sales tactic - specifically their "unlimited traffic" annual<br>plans.  These tactics are "questionable" even with the most favorable interpretation,<br>and in our opinion are grossly-misrepresented during their sales cycle.<br> 
<br>
We do not believe Sortprice would generate a positive ROI for *any* client on the<br>platform.  Zoovy could not with a clear conscious do anything which resembled an<br>endorsement of their business tactics.  (Selling unlimited traffic when you have<br>virtually no traffic to sell is unethical).<br>
<br>
If clients are looking for ways to increase their sales with an effective ROI we<br>recommend contacting our Marketing Services group to have an analysis done.  Zoovy<br>is happy to guarantee a better return dollar for dollar than sortprice would generate.<br>
<br>
However it is not our goal to restrict your business - as with any 3rd party<br>marketplace - sortprice automation can be accomplished as a custom feed, at an<br>hourly rate - probably for just a few hundred dollars.	 However - again,<br>we would recommend against it, and believe it would not have a positive effect on your ROI.
