<h2>Backup Database</h2>

You should backup your database before ANY upgrade or change. In addition it is a good idea to backup your database before you run a defrag or any sort of disk compression program. By backing up your data you ensure that any changes you have made locally which may or may not have been synchronized with the Zoovy servers are safe. Normally Zoovy will keep a backup of your data, however Zoovy does NOT keep a copy of your local preferences such as label setup, and admin preferences, and local users.
