<h1>Sales Comparison: StoneEdge Order Manager vs. Order Manager</h1>

<article>
<h2>Concept Overview</h2>

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
StoneEdge Order Manager is a competitor to the Zoovy Order Manager. 
This document is intended to provide a line by line comparison for discussion between the two systems. 

</div>
</aside>



Zoovy does not support integration with StoneEdge Order Manager. Zoovy provides a free, and in many ways superior desktop client entitled Zoovy Order Manager.  The cost of maintaining StoneEdge support - considering the extremely limited number of users that would utilize it's features makes it infeasible. 

Zoovy has never installed, downloaded, or otherwise compared our software. We prefer to add features based on our customer's requests, not line by line comparisons of what our competitors are doing.

StoneEdge is limited because it needs to accomodate the limitations of many different e-commerce platforms. It's sort of like the difference between getting a do-it-yourself "universal" car-cover, and one from the dealer that is made specifically for your car.

<h2>Zoovy Advantages</h2>

Order Manager is included with the Zoovy subscription and includes upgrades included with the account. 

There are a lot of things Zoovy does better, this is not inteneded to be a comprehensive list.

<li> Unified Employee Accounts
<li> Paypal Express Checkout (charge when ship)
<li> GoogleCheckout Integration (charge when ship)
<li> Amazon.com order integration (charge when ship)
<li> Fully Certified Native FedEx/UPS airbill printing (no need for 3rd party applications)
<li> Encrypted database both MS-Access and robust MySQL versions available.
<li> Superior Quickbooks qbXML integration (no IIF file support anymore)
<li> Customer Portal for CRM, integrated tracking and rma/ticket within your website using the same username/password from your website. 
<li> Synchronized order payment status with Website / Customer Portal.
<li> Actionable Reports - ability to create email campaigns directly from reports. 
<li> Incremental Inventory Updates - incoming product is applied as a +/- rather than a constant, meaning web orders do not cause inventory to become desynchronized.
<li> Negative Inventory Support - zoovy allows products to be "negative", stone-edge does not allow negative inventory numbers (when new items come in, you need to manually subtract inventory using stone-edge)
<li> eBay reserved inventory support, support for non-checked out ebay sales.

      Streamline the process of placing orders with fulfillment centers, whether they are company-owned or independent contractors.<br>
    ZOOVY: Yes
    <li>

      Create “fulfillment centers”.<br>
    ZOOVY: Yes
    <li>

      Assign products to fulfillment centers individually or by category.<br>
    ZOOVY: Yes

    <li>

      Supports orders that include items that must be ordered from different fulfillment centers.<br>
    ZOOVY: Yes  (note: none of the integrated e-commerce applications do NOT support this, so you need to handle everything manually with stone-edge on the e-commerce side)
    
    <li> 

      COMING SOON: Web-based fulfillment system! Automatically transmit orders to fulfillment centers and import shipping and tracking data back into the Order Manager. Fulfillment centers will be able to use their own copy of the Order Manager, or a Web-based system.<br>
    ZOOVY: We've had this for 5 years. 
      

<li> The Stone Edge Order Manager is a proven system for merchants who drop ship products directly from their vendors.  You have full control over how your drop shipments are handled.  By specifying which products get drop shipped and which vendors you get each product from the Order Manager can easily automate the dreadfulness of preparing numerous drop ship purchase orders for each order and each vendor.   Even if you have a product that you normally ship out of your own stock, with a few mouse clicks you can easily revise the item ordered to be drop shipped... once that is done let the Order Manager automate the generation of your purchase order.<br>
ZOOVY: Possible, but not easy. However field reports from other clients indicate this does not work well on StoneEdge either. 



<li> Now what about sending these purchase orders?  You will tell the Order Manager how each supplier wants to receive drop-ship notices: email, fax, mail, etc.   With this information the Order Manager can automatically generate a unique purchase order for each vendor and send that to them based on the criteria you established for that vendor.<br>

    <li>

      Many reports have "system parameters" that let you do limited customization very easily<br>
      ZOOVY: Yes
    <li>

      Any standard report can be replaced with a customized version<br>
      ZOOVY: Yes

    <li>

      Add your own custom reports and have them appear in the Report Menu<br>

      Unique system protects your custom reports when you install new versions of the Order Manager 
Queries, too! <br>
      ZOOVY: Yes, except when DB Schema changes. 

Since the Order Manager is an "open system", if you are familiar with Microsoft Access you can also create your own Access "queries" to collect and display or print exactly the information you need!<br>
      ZOOVY: No, we encrypt our databases for enhanced security. With Access any employee or hacker with access to the application can download your entire company order history and sell it to a competitor.

Once this feature is turned on in the Order Manager, the program will collect detailed information about your sales activities. Whenever you like, you can export the latest data from the Order Manger into a specially formatted text file called an "iif" file that can then be imported into QuickBooks.<br>
      ZOOVY: No, Zoovy supports qbXML integration with Quickbooks, no IIF file is necessary. 
      
There are two broad categories of information that can be exported: sales information and deposits. You can set up the Order Manager to export either or both types of data.<br>
ZOOVY: Yes, via online report.

Sales information is exported as General Journal Entries. It can be exported summarized by day and account, or with full details. It includes sales, sales taxes, shipping charges, discounts, surcharges, coupons and cost of goods sold. You can use one or more sales accounts. Items can be assigned to sales accounts individually, by inventory category, by a system-wide default sales account or any combination of those methods.<br>
ZOOVY: No.<br>
<br>

Deposit Data includes Order Manager transactions, which are created any time a payment is received or a credit issued. Payments received are exported as deposits, and are summarized by date and payment method, with an option to combine Visa and MasterCard payments. Credits issued are exported as individual checks. You can decide which payment methods should be exported, and to which QuickBooks accounts. Each payment method can have a number of "delay days" so, for example, you can assume that Visa and MasterCard payments are deposited to your account the next business day, but American Express and Discover charges take 5 days to be deposited. You can also set a cutoff time, so that payments received after that time of day are assumed to come in the following day.<br>
ZOOVY: No. This information is available, but not presented in a similar manner.
