<h1>Edit Shipping</h1>

<h2>General</h2>

<br><br>
You can easily edit the shipping for any order. When you click the shipping button or the picture
of an airplane in order edit, a shipping edit window will appear. The edit shipping window
has two portions, the bottom portion is a free entry area where you can change the shipping
description and price. The upper portion requires that you are connected to the Internet and
will contact Zoovy and transmit the information about the order currently being edited and will
use the values entered to compute the price based on your companies shipping policies.

The shipping edit tool will use the edited version of the cart, NOT the saved version. For
example if you add a 100 lb. Gorilla to an order but do NOT hit save and then attempt to calculate
shipping you will find that the 100 lb. Gorilla is included in the price. HOWEVER, unless you hit save in order edit then any new shipping price will not be committed to the order either.
