Hello,
We were informed by Fusemail that one of their servers is down and currently being worked on. They will have this back up and running as soon as possible!

Hi,

I attempted to log in using both accounts and was now successful. We still have not gotten an official word from Fusemail letting us know this is fully operational so I don't want to say it's good to go. If you can continue to test this and let us know if you're still having problems logging in then we can update them.

Let us know if you still can't log in.

Thanks
Mario

I can log in now but the "lights payments" folder only shows about 6 messages in Outlook, but all of them via webmail.  My support folder when logged in under "admin@888kniveisrus.zoovy.com" is unusable.  It will tell me I have XX messages unread, but looking at the messages there were over 35 that showed as unread and when I click on any of them it says that there is a system error and can't find the message.  None of the messages in the support folder appear in outlook.

### Tech Notes ###

Logged in to webmail using admin@888knivesrus.zoovy.com

Folder "Lights Payments"
Has at least 1 unread message in it but they don't show next to the folder name. Clicking on any unread message in this folder shows this error:

The system could not find your requested email message, it may have been deleted by you on another session or a temporary server error.

Folder "Support"
Has many unread messages but are also not shown next to the folder name. Clicking any unread message in this folder also shows the above error.

Hello,

I was informed by fusemail that they have applied a fix to the account which should resolve those problems. I checked on both folders myself and was able to read messages this time without any errors. I can't test this on Outlook though. Can you confirm this is functioning properly now on both webmail and Outlook?

Keep us posted

Thanks
Mario

Confirmed behavior in Support folder.
Unread messages generate this message when clicked:
The system could not find your requested email message, it may have been deleted by you on another session or a temporary server error.

Updated fusemail ticket to notify them that their "fix" did not work.

Still not working.  Having issues with support and older messages in Info.  Called fusemail this am to give them some info, but I'm still down.  Support also will not sync with outlook.  It worked fine until fusemails server outage about 3 days ago.  I didn't change anything but my email has been unusable for about 3 days.

Merchant called and wanted to know what the status is on this.  Merchant called fusemail yesterday and they recognized the issue and stated that they will have to escalate this issue to a higher level

Karlo currently is in a meeting with Brian and I will ask him to call merchant back to give him a status to this ticket.

Still having the problem with both the info and support folders.  Also it seem when I am logged in as Admin, Lisa with whom the folders are shared has trouble accessing them.  It seems to cause her outlook to lock up for long periods.

Hello DC, 

I had a customer with a similar issue this past week.  I have submitted your account to fusemail support.  I've also reset the cache on your email.  We may need to unshare then reshare the folders to get them to work again if that doesn't seem to do the trick. I've incidented this ticket to myself to keep closer track on it.

Please let me know of any questions in the meantime.

Thanks,

Hey DC, 

I just got off the phone with them.  I'm working with their tech Dale, he's been trying to keep on top of their Sys Ops for me.  He is going to have his manager give me a call in a bit regarding a possible update on the issue.  I'll keep you informed.
