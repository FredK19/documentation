<h2>What are the benefits of using a Windows application rather than a Web browser to manage online orders?</h2>

Although Zoovy’s Web interface provides excellent control, operating any software through the Web can slow down productivity. The Zoovy Windows application enables merchants to bypass this potential problem and work directly from their own PC, using extra features that accelerate performance and add polish to their presentation. Merchants can easily perform routine tasks such as managing customers and orders, printing shipping labels and invoices, automatically sending e-mail confirmations, generating targeted newsletters and synchronizing with other software such as Intuit’s QuickBooks.

<h2>What is the Zoovy SLA (Service Level Agreement) and Security Policy (SP)</h2>


Zoovy takes every effort it can to ensure that Service Level Agreements (SLA)'s are not necessary. Our infrastructure is designed to be fully redundant and fault tolerant. However we do not provide a formal service level agreement as a standard part of our service.  Zoovy has designed our infrastructure for 99.99% availability, and we normally answer all tickets within 1 business day.


<br>

Customers who are considering requesting a Service Level Agreement should review the following two documents since they may answer a variety of questions and demonstrate why a service level agreement is not in fact necessary:

<a class="linkdoc" href="#?doc=50643">Doc 50643</a>

<br>


Due to the multitude of offerings - Zoovy does not include a blanket service level guarantee as a standard part of our offering but instead prefers to create a custom one (within our service capabilities) for each client. Upon request Zoovy will incorporate a service level agreement of 99.95% with regards to system availability, and 3 business day ticket response time to tickets at no charge. Customers who desire a more stringent service level agreement should discuss those terms as part of a negotiated pricing agreement package.
