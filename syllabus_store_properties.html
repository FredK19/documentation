Click on Setup and then Shipping in the Store Properties box.
<aside class="cbc">
<h6>Special shipping considerations</h6>
<div>
<li>How much do you pay for shipping? Are you covering your costs?
<li>How do you currently charge for shipping? If your method suits your needs, there is no need to make changes.
<li>Do you have any special exceptions to how you ship? You can establish special exceptions to your shipping, but this will likely require use of the SHIPPING bundle. The SHIPPING bundle is an additional charge to your Zoovy account.

<h2>Checkout Setup</h2>
