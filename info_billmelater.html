[[SECTION]Concept Overview]
[[TAG]billmelater=1000]

At this time Zoovy does not support Bill-me-later integration. 
Bill me later works exclusively with clients which are doing in excess of $10m annual sales. 

[[BREAK]]

[[CAUTION]]
We have confirmed reports that Bill-me-later will be launching a pilot program with
merchant-e-solutions in 2008.  Zoovy has no plans to support the Merchant-e-solutions integration/gateway at this time.

7/08/08 -- 
Just had a conversation with Karen from Bill Me Later.
Merchant-e-solutions has a pilot program for them for clients under $10m annual gms.

Currently there is no way to board clients under $10m except via Merchant-e-solutions, but to be clear, the program has not gone live, when it does, they expect other processors e.g. paymenttech to follow suite. 

They expect more processors to have low volume programs available in the fall.

ChasePayment Tech only supports Billmelater on the Salem platform (i'll check and see what our clients are setup on)

Rates are 2.15% + $0.15 for 45 days same as a cash, and 4% for 90 days same as cash.
No setup fees, some $100/mo. ACH withdrawl fee.
