<div>You can not issue a partial credit within the first 24 hours. If you try to issue a partial credit it will be considered a full credit until the transaction settles. It takes 24 hours for a transaction to settle with Authorize.net. When issuing a credit within the first 24 hours; we will send the request to Authorize.net as a credit but they will change the credit request to Void. Best practices suggest that you wait 24 hours before the issue of credits to ensure that everything runs smoothly.
