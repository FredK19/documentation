[[TITLE]Sidebar/Decals Option]

[[SECTION]Concept Overview]

The sidebar function in themes allows you to automatically display pre-defined service provider logos on your web site.  The sidebar feature is also used to add information to the HEAD section of your website.


[[STAFF]]

Changes to the sidebar basically saves a chunk of html someplace.
So changes made to the store elsewhere that effect the sidebar (such as facebook url)
will not automagically update the sidebar.  To reset, simply make a change to the sidebar
and save.  Voila.

[[SECTION]Adding logos in your wrapper]
There is a predetermined set of logos available to you which can be enabled/disabled through the chooser.

[[CAUTION]]
Currently, all your stores share the same sidebar, so you can not configure the logos per specialty store.
[[/CAUTION]]

[[CBC]Enabling specific logos in the sidebar]
<li>Log in to your account at www.zoovy.com</li>
<li>Click on the setup tab</li>
<li>Click on the site builder link</li>
<li>Click on the sidebar link next to the site theme prompt</li>
<li>Use the left/right arrow buttons to move logos into the 'Selected Logos' area</li>
<li>Use the 'Move Up' or 'Move Down' buttons to change the order</li>
<li>Save your changes</li>
[[/CBC]]

These logos will now appear in your theme.  The exact location of the sidebar is determined by the theme you are using.  Not all themes are compatible with the sidebar feature.

[[CAUTION]]
The Thawte logo available through the chooser is very wide and make 'break' the aesthetic of the theme you are using.  The checkbox at the bottom of the page for 'show thawte Authentic... on secure pages' does not use the wide logo.

[[SECTION]Adding 'code' to your sidebar for specific partners]

In some cases, enabling a sidebar logo requires you to paste in partner specific code.  For instance, if you enable the Authorizenet or buySafe seal you will need to paste in the seal code at the bottom of the sidebar entry page (the prompt will appear once you push save). Until you've added that code, the partner icon will not show up.

[[SUBSECTION]FaceBook]

Facebook likes to make things difficult. In some cases, to enable a facebook decal like 'like' or 'send' or 'comments' you may need to have some additional modifications made to your wrapper to set some FB specific parameters.
[[BREAK]]
At least they offer a decent troubleshooting tool to make it easier on you/us. At this url, you can paste in the page on your store that you have the facebook code on, and it will tell you what changes/additions need to be made:

[[CAUTION]]

The facebook code for tracking conversions will break some of the facebook plugins if it loaded prior to the decals. the best way to prevent this is to add the conversion tracking code to the 'footer' not the 'head'.
