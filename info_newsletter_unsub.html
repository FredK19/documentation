<h2>Welcome to Zoovy!</h2>
Congratulations and welcome to Zoovy!<br>

This brief introduction should help you build your Zoovy account, but it is by no means intended to replace the usual training process. Please be certain to schedule a training session as soon as you've decided to go with Zoovy. To schedule training, click on the Support link in the upper right corner of your Zoovy account. On the next screen, click on the Schedule Appointment link, next to the picture of the mouse. The times that appear are available appointments. Click on the slot that is convenient to you. Your personal business consultant / trainer / implementation assistant / project manager is waiting for you.<br>

Even if an appointment is not available for several days, you are not “dead in the water.” Please take the time to go over the following before you enter training.<br>

<h3>Shipping</h3>

<aside class="cbc">
<h6>Since you are building an online store, it's traditional to charge a customer for shipping upon checkout. You will need to ship the item after it has been purchased, of course, but what we are concerned with right now is how the customer is charged for shipping. Some things to consider…</h6>
<div>

<li>If you have been selling online previously, how do you currently charge for shipping? 
<li>If you want to charge actual rate based on the weight of the item and the location it is being shipped to, whose rates should you use? UPS? USPS? FedEx? DHL? If you do not already have one, you may want to open an account with your preferred shipping provider.  

<li>Do you know how you will calculate shipping? If so, great! You may proceed. If your shipping is “complicated,” take time to figure out what makes it so. If you understand the stumbling blocks in configuring your shipping, your trainer may help come up with a solution. (Of course, first we need to diagnose the problem)

<div>The Shipping setup is found in your Zoovy account under Setup > Shipping. If you feel comfortable configuring this on your own, feel free to do so, but your trainer will be happy to assist you.

<div>If you are now saying to yourself, “My salesperson promised me that I could do X, Y, and Z! This one page introduction did not tell me how to do X, Y, and Z!”, don't run off and angrily demand a full refund, try scheduling a training session with one of our Zoovy technicians. In all likelihood, we can do X, Y, and Z. It's just a little more complicated than can be covered here. There are many aspects of Zoovy that fall beyond the basics.

<div>Even if you feel you have a good grasp of how Zoovy works, we still encourage you to take advantage of your free training. Often, your trainer can suggest ways of utilizing Zoovy that you may not have considered. We are committed to making you successful. When you do well, we do well!
