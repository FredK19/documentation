<h1>Converting from AuctionWorks to Zoovy</h1>

<h2>Data Import</h2>

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>

If you're feeling exceptionally lazy you can might consider simply requesting an import of your running eBay auctions.
Please read the details on importing listings from eBay.com
<a taget="_top" href="http://webdoc.zoovy.com/info/index.php?GOTO=guide/convert-ebay.php">Click Here</a>
This probably won't get all your data, but at least it will provide a starting point.

Once you have exported your Customers and/or Products using the Export feature in AuctionWorks you will need to remove AuctionWorks header
and replace it with a Zoovy header. AuctionWorks regularly changes it's export format, and so it's very difficult (if not impossible) to keep 
this file up to date. In general it is safe to assume that you can ignore new fields by simply leaving the header field blank.<br>
<br>
If you need assistance please contact your assigned implementation technician.<br>

Auction Works regularly changes it's export format. 
We recommend you import the AuctionWorks CSV file into Excel and verify the column orders are still correct.
Zoovy makes no warranty with regards to accuracy of this information.

<h2>Getting Acclimated</h2>

<li> AuctionWorks calls them "Auctions" whereas Zoovy calls them "Channels"
<li> LaunchBots are called "Scheduled Channels"
<li> You'll find a lot of the equivalent reports that AuctionWorks offers in the Order Manager - we do not offer web based equivalents.
<br>
<br>
<b>Avoiding Culture Shock:</b><br>
In general you'll find Zoovy is much more flexible than AuctionWorks with regards to how "you want to run your business" - but this is not necessarily a good thing!
In our experience AuctionWorks offers a program which is designed to be a "one size fits all sellers" - this is particularly well suited for getting sellers started.
Unfortunately as sellers become more and more advanced they find the "one size fits all" approach more restrictive and cumbersome.
Zoovy was built with fundamentally different assumptions than AuctionWorks, we are much more focused on branding, and encouraging repeat business. 
Zoovy looks at Auctions such as eBay as a terrific way to generate additional brand exposure and find new customers, not necessarily as "a pure auction tool"
(not that you can't use Zoovy that way, but it's important to understand we started from a different place).<br>
<br>
Zoovys #1 priority in design is flexibility and the ability to adapt to specific business models.
At the same time a lot of sellers migrating from AuctionWorks find Zoovys unstructured approach towards listings very frustrating, 
especially when compared to AuctionWorks highly structured and rigid approach. 
For this we can only offer the following advice:<br>
<br>
Just remember why you're switching!
There is nothing you can do on AuctionWorks that you can't do on Zoovy - whereas there are lots of things you can do with Zoovy that you can't
do with AuctionWorks! Be patient - be willing to "think outside the box" and you'll do fine!<br>
<br>
<!--
We specifically mention being courteous because AuctionWorks customers have a nefarious reputation of being rude and impatient.
We're not sure why this is - 
perhaps it's because by the time they find Zoovy they've already outgrown their current solution, 
perhaps it's something to do with their previous experiences dealing with AuctionWorks technical support,
perhaps it's something to do with the amount of money they pay versus the value they get, 
perhaps it's the <a target="_player" href="alec.mp3">CEO</a>,
but to be honest we're not sure what the reason is!<br>
<br>
<br>
But you should be aware that Zoovy technical support does not operate anything like AuctionWorks - we are different company and we'd
appreciate if you'd leave your baggage at the door.
We also believe that when a merchant is abusive towards us, they are likely the same way toward their customers, 
and that ultimately reflects poorly on all Zoovy merchants. Simply put: we have a zero tolerance policy for rude behavior.

Each seller is an adult who is responsible for their own words in the forums and support tickets, 
and as such we do not moderate [remove/edit] posts - but based on those posts we do take action.
We also want you to recognize that it is not our business plan "to be like auction works".
If you are not happy here at Zoovy, we'd rather see you to leave and come back when you've grown to a size that our tools are the correct fit.
<br>
<br>
We encourage you to purchase Zoovy ONLY after evaluating all possible platforms for your business and deciding Zoovy is the right one for you.
Go ahead check out Andale, Channel Advisor, Vendio, Turbo Lister, Seller Assistant Pro, and any other solutions you have may come across in your travels.
Once you have made the decision that Zoovy is the best fit - then recognize we're here to help you!
