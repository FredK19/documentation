<h2>Issue #161254: Paypal charging wrong shipping amount</h2>

Order's going through Paypal have incorrect shipping amount (does not match invoice).

<aside class="hint">

<div>
This is *NOT* a Zoovy issue. This is a *PAYPAL* issue. 
<br>
We recommend customers contact Paypal's support group regarding this issue.  (We hope that *SOMEDAY* Paypal might actually correct it if they get enough merchants who are confused by it.)

<h2>Resolution</h2>
The sellers Paypal account is incorrectly configured to add shipping to every order, even though Zoovy CORRECTLY passes the shipping to Paypal.

This is ridiculously easy to do since eBay helps sellers configure this.

<h2>Steps to Verify</h2>

The direct link to cause Zoovy to trigger a Paypal redirect is:
<aside class="html">
<h6></h6>
<code>
http://USERNAME.zoovy.com/paypal.cgis?orderid=YYYY-MM-#####&email=buyer@domain.com

</code>
</aside>


<br>

The buyer is redirected to a Paypal screen - but before the redirect occurs it is possible to press ESCAPE in the browser at the redirect page.  View the source and save it to a file on your hard disk.

<br>

View the shipping amount being sent to Paypal - it is correct.
<aside class="html">
<h6></h6>
<code>
&lt;input type="hidden" name="shipping_1" value="28.25"&gt;

</code>
</aside>

If Paypal complains about a "duplicate transaction" or how the order was already paid - you can save the redirect file to your hard disk, and use a text editor (such as textpad)  to change the invoice # in the file so you can retry the same payment to Paypal.
