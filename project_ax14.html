<h1>Project: Configuring Advanced Shipping</h1>

<article>
<h2>Concept Overview</h2>

Intended for people who have very complicated shipping which will be handled by the system, and/or which may require a custom shipping API. 
However this should always be done after Basic Zoovy Orientation and after the customer has added at least a handful of products and configured their website.

This project should ideally be completed early in the process so a shipping API can be added if necessary. If a custom shipping API is required then additional fees will apply.
