<h2>Concept Overview</h2>
Web Interfaces are excellent when you make infrequent updates to your website or product database. However if your business is constantly adding and removing products, updating inventory availability, or adding images then it will most certainly experience productivity gains from the benefit of a specialized desktop application.

<h2>Key Benefits</h2>
In addition Warehouse Manager has functionality that cannot be paralleled in a web interface.

<section>
<h3>Image Cropping, Resizing</h3>
The ability to import a variety of images, from different image formats and sources, including built in TWAIN support for scanners or some types of digital cameras.  Once an image is imported it can be cropped, or resized, or annotated automatically before uploading to Zoovy. 
</section>

<section>
<h3>Management Categories</h3>

Management Categories are an internal category structure that you use to keep track of your products. Some features inside Zoovy such as the supply chain module automatically put products into management categories. Management categories are NOT seen by customers on your website. A product can only exist in one Management Category (unlike Navigation categories where a product can exist in multiple categories).

<section>
<h3>Barcode Printing</h3>
Warehouse Manager includes the ability to print out a bar code for your products. This can be used as a compliment to the Package Verification feature found in Zoovy Order Manager.
