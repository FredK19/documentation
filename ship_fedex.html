<h1>FedEx</h1>

<h2>Set Up</h2>

Zoovy supports all popular FedEx services. There's not a lot of configuration that can go on except for the handling charge. The handling charge can be either a fixed price like $1.00 or a variable +%10, which would add ten percent to the quoted shipping rates. Some people use the handling charge to accommodate the weight of the boxes and packing materials, others use it to cover both supplies and employee time. If you need to add an insurance fee, or other charge based on the total of the order then use global tuning in conjunction with FedEx shipping.

<h2>NOTE:</h2>

It's worth mentioning that if you don't put in your FedEx number that the shipping system will default to Zoovy's fedex number which quotes high shipping rates, and an origin from zip code 92007.
