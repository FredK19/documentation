<h2>Designing Your Product Page</h2>

Each time you create a new product, the default Zoovy page layout (page flow as we call them here) is selected.  At any time, you can change this to better accomodate this particular products needs. Wide, Long, and multiple picture formats are available.  Can't find a flow that meets your needs?  Talk to your salesperson about having a custom flow designed.  Currently, there is no way to specify your default product page layout.
