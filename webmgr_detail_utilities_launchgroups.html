<h2>Queuing Strategies</h2>



Launch Groups support a variety of "Queueing Strategies" - a detailed explanation of each one is provided below:

<aside class="hint">

<div>

If you set the Max Products per launch to either -1 (unlimited) or a value greater than the number of products
in the group then the queuing strategy is irrelevant since all products will be launched every time.

<h3>Round Robin</h3>

This selects products in a sequential order. 
Each Launch Group keeps an internal count of how many listings it has performed, which is then divided by the
number of products in the list and the remainer determines the beginning offset in the product list. 
When the end of the list is reached it starts over at the beginning. 

<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>

In Round Robin - a products position in the list determines its order in the launch. If the products position changes 
(e.g. items are added or removed from the list, or the sequence is resorted in a different order) then 
products may be either passed over, or launched duplicately. Round Robin is almost certainly not the best 
queuing strategy for highly contentious lists of products whose order and sequence change frequently.

<section>
<h3>Sell Thru</h3>

This data goes to the specific marketplace and pulls the total number of listings, and total number of sales over the
past 90 days. A simple ratio is computed and the items with the highest sell thru ratio are used. 
If an item has no sales record, it's sell thru percentage is set at 100% so it will sell.

<section>
<h3>In Stock</h3>


The "In Stock" queuing strategy looks at the number in stock, removes reserve inventory and then uses those items which have the highest
available quantity for sale.

</article>
<section>
<h3>Recent</h3>


The "Recent" queuing strategy looks at the modified times for each product. 
A product is modified anytime it is saved or edited in any way.

</article>
<section>
<h3>Least Recently Used</h3>


This attempts to find the total number of listings for all marketplaces, and launch those items 
which are NOT being listed as frequently (and therefore may not have been sold).
