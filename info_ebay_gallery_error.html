<h2>Issue Detail</h2>
You may sometimes receive email from ebay that they are unable to obtain a gallery image.  Below is a common example of the email form they send out:<br>

<i>
"Dear Seller:<br>
DO NOT REPLY TO THIS MESSAGE. SEE BELOW FOR INSTRUCTIONS.<br>
      
Thank you for choosing to be part of eBay's Gallery! 
Unfortunately, your item (eBay item number here)

has not yet been added to the gallery.<br>
The problem is:<br>

We could not connect to the Web server name specified by:<br>
http://static.zoovy.com/img/merchant_name/code/imagename<br>

Check your image URL to make sure that it is correct.

You can correct your URL at:<br>
http://cgi5.ebay.com/ws1/eBayISAPI.dll?DisplayGalleryImagePageV3&Item=250057135

Thank you for using eBay! "

<h3>Causes</h3>
Various situations can cause this problem to occur and have an email automatically generated.  It could be that zoovy's image severs were/are down at the time ebay attempted to pull the image, it could be that ebay was having connection issues at the time of the error, or there maybe internet traffic problems that are not directly related to zoovy or ebay that are causing ebay to be unable to connect and pull down the image.

<h3>"How can I correct this and is it a problem?"</h3>
The best way to tell if this is a serious issue that is ongoing is to try and cut and paste the url for the image (found in the email) into a browser and see if you can pull up the image correctly.  If you can, it was a temporary problem.  If you can not, you should notify zoovy tech support of the issue.<br>
To correct the issue, go to the other link listed in the email ("You can correct your URL at:") and follow the instructions there.  You can set the URL to the same one as originally listed, given that you can in fact pull up that image yourself.  This should trigger ebay to attempt to bring down the image again.
