<h2>AOL Support</h2>
Support for AOL becomes very difficult in many cases because they set their own rules and conventions.  Many times these rules are different than those set by the largest market share browsers (IE and Firefox). In order to provide you with the best features for your web presence, we try to adapt the newest stable trends internet/browser functionality. 
Unfortunately, this can mean at times that the display for AOL users is less than optimal.
