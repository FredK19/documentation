<h2>Advanced EBay Training</h2>







Once you have successfully launched to EBay through Zoovy, you will probably want to take advantage of some of the advanced tools we have to offer. This is an optional training, only required for customers that intend to use EBay as a marketplace.
<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>It is very important that you have complete comprehension of EBay 1A and EBay 1B before you attempt to use these tools.

<h2>PREREQUISITES</h2>
Please launch at least one test auction before using these tools. We want to know that you are launching to EBay in the way that you want to before we start automating the process.

<div>These features are only available to user's with the Auction Bundle.

<h2>Advanced EBay Tools</h2>
<section>
<h3>Schedule Listings</h3>
Zoovy allows you to schedule and automatically re-list EBay ads at certain time intervals. Unlike EBay's scheduler, this is a free unlimited service to users with Zoovy's Auction Bundle.
</section>
<section>
<h3>Powerlister</h3>
Powerlister allows you to repeat your EBay listings based on certain situations. This is the optimal solution for deep inventory items that you want consistently on EBay.
</section>
<section>
<h3>Batch Channel Launcher</h3>
Batch Channel Launcher allows you to select several products and launch them all at once. This tool can be combined with the Scheduler or Powerlister in order to have that group repeat as often as you wish.
</section>
<section>
<h3>EBay Stores Syndication</h3>
EBay Stores Syndication is an easy way to keep your EBay Store populated with the products in your Zoovy online store.
</section>
<section>
<h3>Batch Channel Editor</h3>
The Batch Channel Editor allows you to remove and/or revoke several listings at once.
</section>
</article>
<article>
<h2> Refresh Listings</h2>
There are certain fields you can't refresh. You can't refresh across eBay accounts (e.g. move a listing from one eBay user to another). You can't refresh a product id (e.g. change the product ID or sku of a listing once it's been created). You also can't refresh to change profiles (e.g. move a product from one profile to another).

<h2>Homework</h2>
Before you move on to the next topic, find a way of using EBay through Zoovy that simulates the way that you have been selling on EBay before coming to Zoovy.<br>
If you have not been using EBay before coming to Zoovy, ensure that you are comfortable with how it works through Zoovy.
