<h2>Exporting your CSV file from Microsoft Office Live</h2>






You will need to export a spreadsheet of products from your Office Live account, Zoovy allows uploading these products to your 

account as a CSV import.

<aside class="cbc">
<h6>How to export your CSV</h6>
<div>
<li> 1. Log in to your Microsoft account.
<li> 2. Go to 'More'
<li> 3. Go to 'Sell Online'
<li> 4. Go to 'Add Products & Images'
<li> 5. Go to 'Edit Product Offline'
<li> 6. Click 'Download Product List'
<li> 7. Save the CSV file onto your desktop.

<h2>Important Notes about your CSV</h2>
<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>It is important that you make a backup copy of your original CSV to avoid permanently losing any important data.
</div>
</aside>

Once you've exported your CSV from Microsoft you will have to open it in a spreadsheet program such as OpenOffice or Excel. 

There you will need to edit your CSV to change the column headings used by Microsoft and replace them with the Zoovy 

equivalents. Also, there will be columns that won't be necessary on the initial CSV upload and can be added at a later time. 

For example, 'Category ID' and 'Category Path' should be saved for a separate "Category Import"
<br>
Please Note that toward the bottom of your exported CSV there will be a section beginning with:
<li>"# Category Details (for reference only - to modify categories please use online tool.)"
<br>
This will need to be removed from your CSV since that information is not used in your Product Import.

<h2>About Product Options</h2>
Your products may have Options associated with them. These product options can be removed from the CSV that will be initially 

imported into Zoovy in order to keep the initial import as simple as possible. You can easily differentiate which ones are 

options by looking for their title in the 'Variation Title' column of your Microsoft CSV. Product options can be configured 

later as Store Option Groups or Product Option Groups in the Zoovy product editor.

<h2>About Product Images</h2>
It is recommended that you use the Zoovy Media Library to upload your product images. Those images can then be associated with each product in this CSV. 
<br>
Example: Uploading an image called 'picture.jpg' would typically go in a folder titled 'P'. <br> The proper syntax in the CSV column for zoovy:prod_image1 would be: P/picture.jpg  <br>'P' is the folder name and 'picture.jpg' is the file name.

<br>
If you are a basic shop cart merchant just coming over from Microsoft then you may not have access to the Zoovy Media Library. If that is the case then you'll need to populate the 'zoovy:prod_image1' field with an image URL such as this:
<br>
http://www.yoururl.com/picture.jpg
<br>
OR
<br>
You'll need to add images to your products after the initial product import. You can just delete the zoovy:prod_image1 column for now.
