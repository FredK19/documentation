<h1>Constant Contact</h1>

<h2>Concept Overview</h2>

Zoovy offers a competitive email system to constant contact as part of our CRM bundle. The pricing for the Zoovy platform is inclusive for the majority of clients who pay success fees.  For this reason we do not support, or offer integration with the constant contact email platform.  Zoovy does not charge additional fees for the volume, or frequency of how often the list is sent.

<h2>Comparison</h2>

While we recognize that constant contact has a variety of 'novice' email templates, which are simple to use, Constant Contact is an entry level program and therefore lacks many of the benefits of being directly integrated including ROI sales tracking, and ability for customers to opt-out directly from their accounts.  The Constant Contact templates also do not offer any level of consistent brand messaging which we believe results in higher opt-out rates. 

<br>

Many clients over the years have stated that Zoovy's lack of generic email templates is a primary reason for requesting integration of an alternative newsletter system such as Constant Contact. 

<br>

Zoovy does not provide generic email templates.  We provide a handful of samples which are intended for clients who have their own in-house developer, or for clients who want to do a test.  Clients may not realize it is /by design/ that Zoovy does not offer templates, simply put: generic email templates have a much higher opt-out rate, and a lower click-thru-to-sale conversion rate. Zoovy has no intention of providing an equivalent series of templates to Constant Contact - doing so would be irresponsible. To summarize: we aren't going to be build templates, because templates have a far lower conversion rate. 

<br>

Zoovy believes that any short-term benefits gained by using a generic email are a long term detriment.  Once a client has unsubscribed from a newsletter your organization is now actively prohibited by federal law from soliciting that customer again. Since repeat business and word of mouth is a fundamental cornerstone of any successful company - minimizing opt-out rates should be the highest priority of any newsletter email marketer.

<br>

By having a custom email template designed by our graphic department, when a client opens it, and provided it matches key design aspects of the website (where they were comfortable purchasing before) it directly causes higher sell through.  For this reason a custom template will always be superior to any generic email template which is a long term detriment. 

<br>

While we understand nobody likes having to pay to have a custom email template designed - it's important to note that the associated design fees can be put in as a payment plan - such that the lower cost of the Zoovy integrated application, combined with smaller monthly payments, make the Zoovy platform far more affordable.  

<br>

Using Zoovy with a custom email template is more effective, and cheaper than an email marketing service like Constant Contact. For the reasons above Zoovy routinely helps clients migrate from the Constant Contact application to our built-in system and we have absolutely no plans to integrate with it in the future.

Non BPP clients may request the inclusion of Constant Contact, any support or assistance related to the integration is billable.  BPP Premiere Clients are not eligible, and BPP Standard level are discouraged from utilizing it as well for the reasons listed above.
