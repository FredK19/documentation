<h2>Issue #159712: Custom Attribute Name for eBay Store Categories</h2>

I want to use Product Power Tool to change the eBay Store categories on groups of listings.  There are 2 eBay Store categories allowed for each listing, but my Custom Attribute list offers only one.  How do I change the second one?  CSV export doesn't seem to help as I have nothing in a second category, so the name for that second category doesn't export.  I couldn't find any reference in WebDoc.

<h2>Answer</h2>


The attribute for eBay category 2 is ebay:category2.  If you need further assistance, or if you need more information on using the Product Power Tool, please schedule and Implementation Session.
