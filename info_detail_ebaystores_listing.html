<h3>Store Duration and GTC (Good Till Canceled)</h3>
Merchants intending to utilize this feature must take precautions in their ebay.com account to ensure listings are *NOT* upgraded from 30 day listings to Good Till Canceled (GTC) listings. Failure to take precautions may result in loss of privileges of this feature.<br>

Common ways this situation occurs:

<li>   1. eBay sends emails following the end of a 30 day listing offering to upgrade it to GTC.
<li>   2. The "my eBay" interface offers a convenient button to relist non-sold store items.
<li>   3. eBay's selling manager pro subscription enables *automatic* upgrading of 30 day listings to GTC.
<li>   4. If Selling Manager Pro was ever installed on the account, and was subsequently removed, the automatic upgrading of 30 day listings remains in place. In order to disable the merchant must resubscribe to selling manager pro.<br>


Common issues related to this situation:<br>

<li>    * Inventory reserves will expire the day the original 30 day listing was set to end. This will cause overselling!
<li>    * Syndicated listings which are automatically converted to GTC listings will NOT be able to checkout after 90 days of the original ending time.

<div>Many of the above problems/issues will also arise if you setup your ebay profiles to list store listings as GTC duration as well, so be forewarned.
