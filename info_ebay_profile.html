<h1>eBay Profile Tips</h1>








<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>
This webdoc lists several tips on setting up ebay profiles to help you list your products to eBay.  It includes common use tips, along with a couple "gotchas".  Bear in mind that eBay changes their requirements and configuration options quite often, and what works today, may not next week.
<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>Since recent USPS rate changes these tips may be out of date. Please notify support if you should find one that no longer works. Also for further updates of known eBay issues please see  <a class="linkdoc" href="#?doc=50887">Doc 50887</a>

<h2>Tips for configuring your eBay profile</h2>
<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>There are two links for every Profile: "Config" and "Shipping." There is also an HTML Wizard that must be selected. Be certain to setup both parts of your Profile.
</div>

<section>
<h3>Zoovy Rates vs. eBay Rates</h3>
Your eBay Profile uses shipping rates independent of rates that you have configured under Setup > Shipping. Your shipping rules, handling, insurance, etc., configured under Setup > Shipping have nothing to do with the shipping that you configure for eBay. EBay will obtain shipping rates based on the methods you have set in your profile.<br>

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>If you have enabled zoovy:html you will <b> not </b> be able to modify the product description, when launching your items to eBay. You will need to use the product powertool to remove this attribute from the product and channel records. If you aren't familiar with using the product powertool contact support and have them remove this attribute for you and schedule some time with an implementation engineer for instructions on how to successfully use the product powertool.

<section>
<h3>EBay Gallery</h3>
This setting is often missed by merchants, then when the behavior performs as configured, but not as recalled, leaves the merchant believing that something is "broken".  If you want gallery images for any type of listing, select that configuration setting.  Likewise, if you don't want any listing to use gallery images, select that.  If you set this to "Auction Only" and then do not see a galley image when you list a Fixed Price listing, you'll now know why.

<section>
<h3>Flat Rate Shipping</h3>
You must designate a method along with the flat rate for your items when using Flat Rate Shipping.
<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div><li> If you would like the flat rate to be based on a product by product basis, you must first set the price per product. You will then set the shipping cost / additional item cost to -1 <li> If you would like to set a global flat rate for all products, simply input the desired price for shipping cost / additional item cost.

</div>
</aside>

</section>
<br>

<section>
<h3>Free Shipping</h3>
A convenient checkbox has been provided to enable Free Shipping. You must still select a method that corresponds to the Free Shipping offer.
<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>WARNING!  These information is only a suggested method that has worked in the past.  The information is VERY subject to change by Ebay as they frequently change their API in this area without notice.  Try it, test it, and monitor it.  If it DOESN"T work...adjust and test some more.  Implementation or Tech Support may have current tips or tricks on getting free shipping to work on ebay, but don't take this functionality as a given.

<h3> Error Codes</h3>
At the top of the Shipping Profile page, you may see some error codes. Errors that begin with "Z-" are Zoovy errors. Usually, these can be corrected within your Zoovy account. Errors that start with "EBAY-" come from eBay. Often these are requirements that eBay asks for given the shipping methods that you have selected.
<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
<li> " Inconsistent tag values provided. 
 To specify non-zero value for the tag <SalesTaxPercent> you must set "true" for the <CheckoutDetailsSpecified> tag." <br>
This error appears if you have "None" checked under shipping destinations. Uncheck "None."

</div>
</aside>

</section>
<section>
<h3>Return Policy</h3>
Currently Zoovy doesn't set the ebay listing "Return Policy".  We do however allow you to set a return policy inside of your HTML Wizard that will get displayed in your ebay listing layout.  To set this you can go to: Setup > Account Settings:Company Profiles, and click on the eBay Template name of the profile that you wish to adjust your policies.
