<h1>Site Builder / Shopping Cart Page</h1>
<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>

The cart page can be customized just like any other page on the site. It has a special element which is of course the "CART"
element.

<h2>Intelligent Upsell</h2>
Up-selling can be accomplished by adding items to your checkout page. 
There are a variety of ways to do this, the easiest is to simply add your most popular products to the shopping cart page, 
however you can also configure your store to display related and/or accessory products (if you have the XSELL bundle).

<br>

There are three automated options for loading products onto the cart page.  They are 'load accessories', 'load related items' or 'load from category'.  Any of these will look at the items in the cart and use them as the basis for generating the product lists.  If you select 'accessories', the list will load accessory items of the products in the cart.  Related items works in the same manner.  The category option will load items from categories that the product resides in. Currently (2009-10-28) this feature is not specialty-store away.

<li>If you are prompted to do so, choose a layout (layout 3006+ are image based)</li>
<li>Click 'edit' next to the product list element</li>
<li>Change the product source to either "manual, dynamic, or related" based on your needs</li>


</div>
</aside>


Most of the cart layouts have a single product list, however layout 3010 supports up to three product lists. It is recommended you use this layout and set each of the product lists to load the products from a different location.  Choosing accessories as one is highly recommended, if you are using that feature.
