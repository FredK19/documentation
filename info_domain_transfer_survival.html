<h2>Getting started</h2>

<aside class="caution">
<h6>Before you start</h6>
<div>
You must be sure you are the administrative contact for the domain and have access to modifying the domain at its current registry.  Reason for this, You need to UNLOCK the domain and remove any privacy settings in order for the transfer to be allowed.  

<br>

Many domain registrars allow you to unlock the domain directly from the config.  There are some, however, that make it difficult to do so.  The easiest way to get this accomplished is usually to contact the registrar via phone or email and request that they unlock the domain for you.

<h2>WAIT!</h2>
Did you fill out your Company Information completely? You should have done this back when you were doing the basic setup of your account but double-check just in case. Go to Setup &gt; Site Builder and Edit your Company Information. If this is not filled out, you are not going to be able to complete the following steps.

<h2>Step 1: Link the Domain</h2>
Before you can move forward you must have the domain entered into Zoovy and have the domain properly configured. Start by clicking on Setup > Domain Hosting > Add Domains > Link.
</article>

<h2>Step 2: Configure Domain</h2>
Once you have the domain entered, it will appear under Setup > Domain Hosting > Domain Config. You will want to Edit Configuration on your newly purchased domain. Select the appropriate Email and Hosting mode and save.

If you simply want a domain that points to your Zoovy webstore, your Email should be "Zoovymail 2.0" and your Domain Mode should be "(DEFAULT) Default Hosting."

A domain entered under Domain Hosting will be available in your Zoovymail account, if you have one. This is the preferred solution. In order to use Zoovymail, go to Setup > Domain Hosting > Zoovymail and enable Zoovymail. See <a class="linkdoc" href="#?doc=50268">Doc 50268</a> for steps to provisioning a Zoovymail account if you need further help with this step.<aside class="hint">

<h2>Step 4: Setup Mail Aliases</h2>
Assuming that you are using Zoovymail, you will want to login at webmail.zoovy.com and create Mail Aliases for any and all email addresses that you will receive mail to and send mail from for this domain.
<aside class="cbc">
<h6>How to create a mail alias</h6>
<div>
<li> Login at webmail.zoovy.com
<li> Click on the Settings icon at the top of the screen.
<li> Click on Setup Mail Aliases.
<li> Add a new mail alias to a domain name.

<h2>Step 5: Name Servers and Locking</h2>
You will next need to go to the company that currently hosts your domain (such as GoDaddy, Network Solutions, etc.) and log into your domain control panel.  You will need to verify/update your the nameservers. The two nameservers should be set as follows:
<br>
NS.ZOOVY.COM<p>
NS2.ZOOVY.COM
<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>It is VERY important that you change your name servers PRIOR to initiating the transfer request in Step 3.  Generally, if the domain has already been associated with your Zoovy site beforehand, the DNS will already be set correctly.  Simply verify the DNS at this point.
</div>
</aside>

<br>
While you are at your current host, check to see if you need to unlock the domain. A locked domain cannot be transferred.  Also, be sure to disable any privacy settings placed on the domain.  Privacy usually disguises the admin contact information, including the contact email.  Chances are you will NOT receive your transfer request from resellone.net if this is enabled.

<h2>Step 6: Transfer Domain</h2>
Go to Setup > Domain Hosting and click on the Add Domains button. On the following screen, click on the Transfer button. Enter the domain that you want without the leading "www." For example, if you wanted your domain to be "www.zoovy.com" you would just enter "zoovy.com"
<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>It is VERY important that you are the administrative contact for the domain being transferred as all transfer request correspondence will and must go through the contact information listed for it.
