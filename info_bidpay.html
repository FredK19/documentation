<h1>Western Union Bidpay</h1>


<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>
BidPay is available under payment methods (Setup > Payment Methods > Special) as a payment type, however, we are unable to reconcile when you receive money. 
<br>
BidPay does not offer any sort of integration for companies like Zoovy (they only
work with auction sites, not with e-commerce storefonts). 
<br>
Bidpay requires a large amount effort to reconcile payments manually, and will almost
certainly hurt your sales.
