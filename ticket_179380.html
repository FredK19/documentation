Issue: (BH) windows live hotmail rejecting our newsletter

<br>

Platform: na
Topic: other
We sent a newsletter out last week and have received an unusual amount of rejected emails. Predominantly, they are for windows live hotmail (see attached text).  have the zoovy servers or ip addresses been marked as a spam source? </article>

Hello,

We're not aware of Windows Live mail marking zoovy as spam, but I will ask our system admins to look into it.

Thanks,

Ed
