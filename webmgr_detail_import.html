<h2>Avoiding Errors - removing CR/LFs</h2>

The "Carriage Return" and "Line Feed" (CR and LF) are the characters which get
put in when you hit "Enter" on your keyboard. If you are generating your own CSV file, 
use whatever editor you're using to make the CSV file to remove CR and LF characters from the columns.

<br>


Unfortunately, Excel and Access are completely capable of adding the CR and LF characters into
files, but lacks the ability to easily search and replace those specific character codes.	
The message that pops up and says "There are features of excel that are incompatible with the format you are saving in" comes up for a reason, and that
reason is it is excel (and access) support CR/LF in files, and CSV does not. 
CSV is a standard format that we can import from, and Excel is a proprietary
closed format that Microsoft does not make the specs publically available for.

<br>


Actually we found a possible solution for you but we can't make any
guarantees...  this page http://www.j-walk.com/ss/excel/eee/eee009.txt has a
VBA script which may help.  Press Alt-F11 in Excel with the CSV file loaded and
then paste everything between the two sets of three dashes into the window:

<aside class="html">
<h6></h6>
<code>

Sub CleanUp()
Dim TheCell As Range
For Each TheCell In ActiveSheet.UsedRange
    With TheCell
    If .HasFormula = False Then
	.Value = Application.WorksheetFunction.Clean(.Value)
    End If
    End With
Next TheCell
End Sub

</code>
</aside>



Then press the "play" button on the
toolbar, and hit the "run" button when the screen to play the macro pops up. 
The program will go through and clean up tabs and CR/LFs from the file.
<p>

You can also use the SUBSTITUE function in Excel to clear carriage returns and line feeds. For those of you familiar with Excel functions
you simply replace ##COL## in the formulas below with column that has the original text.  These two function have to be run independently.<p>
=SUBSTITUTE(##COL##,CHAR(10),"")   --linefeed<br>
=SUBSTITUTE(##COL##,CHAR(13),"")   --carraige return<p>

This is how it worked for us in Excel 2000, you may have a different version. 
The program above is provided with no warranty, and is NOT SUPPORTED by Zoovy. 
ALWAYS MAKE A BACKUP FIRST.
