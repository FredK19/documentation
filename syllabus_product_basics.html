One of the first things that you are going to want to do is create your products. You cannot run an online store without something to sell. Please take some time to create the items that you will be offering. This is pertinent before moving forward.

<h2>Product Creation Tips</h2>
<section>
<h3>Product ID</h3>
The Product ID in Zoovy Warehouse Manager is limited to 20 characters. You will need to keep your Product ID below this limit.<br>
In some reports throughout Zoovy, the only indication of a product is by the Product ID. You may want to use a Product ID that you can recognize.<br>
The Product ID can be used to group some products together for shipping or promotion rules. If certain products are going to have common shipping parameters, you may want to start those Product ID's with the same first two or three letters or numbers.<br>
To assist in Search Engine Optimization, you may want to have your Product ID match the manufacturer's ID.<br>If you are already using Amazon Seller Central, you may want your Product ID's to match the SKU you use on Amazon.
</section>
<section>
<h3>Product Name</h3>
The Product Name field in Zoovy Warehouse Manager and eBay is limited to 55 characters. You probably want to keep your Product Names below this limit.<br>
This field is brought into the EBay Item Title before you launch it to Ebay. You can change your Ebay Item Title before sending the product to eBay, thereby having a separate title for your webstore and eBay listings.<br>
This is one of the fields that search engines will pick up on. Be sure to insert keywords into your Product Name and repeat those keywords in your Product Description. Repetition helps search engine optimization.
</section>
<section>
<h3>Product Description</h3>
This is the default description that will appear on your website and be sent over to most marketplaces. You want this to be marketplace neutral. Try to avoid EBay specific jargon like "Bid now!" or "This is a no reserve auction."<br>
This is another of the fields that search engines will pick up on. Be sure to insert keywords into your Product Description and repeat those keywords in your Product Name. Again, repetition helps search engine optimization.
</section>
<section>
<h3>Cost</h3>
What you, the merchant, pays for the product. This is used to calculate profit margins but not required in order to sell the product.
</section>
<section>
<h3>MSRP</h3>
Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price can be displayed on the merchant's product pages to showcase the great bargain the customer will receive if he purchases at this online store. For example, "Retail Price: 35.00, Our Price: 20.00"
</section>
<section>
<h3>Base Weight</h3>
This is important if the customer is using a weight-based method of calculating shipping, or if he intends on printing postage in Zoovy Order Manager.<br>
Weight should be the product including packaging.
</section>
<section>
<h3>Is Product Taxable?</h3>
It will only be taxable for the states that you configure to charge sales tax under Setup > Taxes.
</section>

<section>
<h3>Images</h3>
Adding pictures is done in the Images section of the product editor after the product is saved. Click on the "Thumb" or "Image1" links to open the Media Library to upload images from this screen. The image will go into a folder that is labeled by the first letter of the file name. You should upload .jpg or .gif files to the media library.
</section>
<section>
<h3>Inventory</h3>
Inventory is much lower on the product screen. If the merchant is tracking inventory, he or she will need to populate the On Shelf Quantity in order to sell the item.
</section>

<h2>Homework</h2>
Before moving on to the next section, ensure that you have created at least one product as you would like it presented to your customers.<br>
<i>(Optional)</i> If you have an existing database of products in a spreadsheet format, please go to Support > Create Ticket and open a Support ticket. Attach your spreadsheet of products to that ticket and explain that you would like us to import the information for you. This will give you a jump-start in the product creation process.<br></article>
