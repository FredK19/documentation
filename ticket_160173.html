Issue: Google Checkout Question

<br>

Platform: na
Topic: other
In the webdoc about google checkout, it states that "You've provided your public business website URL, and this URL exactly matches the registered URL in your Google Base account."

does this url mean the sjpacific.zoovy.com URL? because I have another URL that more accurately reflects my business and the number of specialty websites that we have, and it is www.ezonlinedeals.com. Can I specify this url instead? Please advise. thanks</article>

<h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
  Sorry if it is confusing hopefully I can shed some light.
"public business website URL" is the "domain.com" address you use for your website. Most customers do not use "user.zoovy.com" as their public website.
