<h2>About this Tool</h2>

The eBay Power Lister is designed to automatically list auctions as they expire.<br>
<br>
NOTE: The Power Lister trigger launch feature - which launches another listing when a specific bid price is reached will not function
unless the customer has a eBay Gallery Channel enabled. This is because on non-gallery auctions the current price and number
of bids is not updated until the auction is closed.
<br>

<h2>Operational Details</h2>

<b>ATTENTION: PowerLister is a Special Type of Channel</b> - it does not follow the rules of other channels.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This channel will typically go from pending to active within 30 minutes of being created. Once it has been picked up by the
eBay system it will say it is "Active" which basically means that it is waiting for something before it can
launch (such as a window of time). During the normal operation of this channel, the channel status may say Completed, this is
because the channel keeps the value of the last auction it processed. Effectively if a powerlister has created and is tracking
3 auctions, and one of them ends with a buy it now, the channel will say completed until the next auction is verified at which
point the status will change from Completed to Active. (In other words, don't trust the channel status - it won't always be right
since there can only be one status, for many auctions).<br>
<br>
Revoking this channel will cause Zoovy to stop relisting the auctions. It will NOT remove the auction from eBay,
any running auctions will be processed normally. Please note that the channel status will say "Revoke Processed" however
the actual channel status will change from Revoke (R) to Active (A) while the remaining auctions are being monitored.
When the powerlister is completed, and all auctions have been processed it will appear in Completed. Any fee credits
which may have been attempted will NOT be attempted. - As long as you see the message "Revoke Processed" in the status
messages, then the channel has been revoked and is simply winding down.
<br>
Remove is not currently implemented. If you want to remove the auctions from eBay you should do the following: #1. Revoke
the channel, #2. Go to the eBay site and end the auction(s) you want to cancel using the eBay interface,
#3. Wait until Zoovy picks up the changes, and processes the remaining auctions.<br>
<br>
Attempting to delete this channel before all remaining auctions have been processed, will cause any remaining
auctions to cease being tracked - wait until all status messages say "Completed" or "Relisted" before attempting to delete
this channel.<br>
<br>
To Make changes to a powerlister channel you must first revoke the existing channel,  clone it, and then relaunch it under
a new channel number. Do not attempt to edit a running powerlister, it is not supported and unspecified errors can occur.<br>
<br>
At the end of this channel, it will be moved to completed and an External Item will be created. External Items appear in the
"Incomplete" section of the order manager (both Windows and Web versions). For more information on external items and claims
please review the documentation in the help area.<br>
<br>

<h2>Known Bugs</h2>

There is a known bug which can occur when attempting to revoke a powerlister. This problem typically occurs
if you run several consecutive auctions and can cause a revoke request to be missed. This happens when
the status of the channel is being updated by the powerlister itself and powerlister overwrites the revoke you saved.
After revoking you should always wait 10 to 15 minutes and verify that the channel has the words "revoke processed" in the status.<br>

I want to run a campaign of 25 listings on ebay. I list these items with a starting bid of $1. Sometimes my items have a rush of bidders. If an auction gets above $20 I want to increase the number of auctions for this item on ebay. I need a minimum of 3 items up, and want a maximum of 7. Just a few minutes apart is fine. I really don't care when they list.

<h2>Configuring Powerlister to check Store Inventory</h2>

<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>

At this time the technique to utilize store inventory IS NOT COMPATIBLE with dutch auctions. (Dutch Auctions are auctions which sell more than 1 product per listing)

</div>
</aside>



Powerlister can be configured to "sell to zero", or more specifically to sell anything on the website -
while it is on the website, and continue selling until the quantity reaches zero.
This technique is also useful in situations where merchants do not list items on their website,
but simply want to maintain inventory from their store rather than editing the powerlister channels.<br>
<br>
To use this it is assumed the customer has their website inventory configured as follows:
<li> track reserved inventory is enabled.
<li> revoke channels when the actual inventory reaches zero is enabled
<li> don't allow customer to purchase more than actual - reserved is enabled.
<li> Inventory must be enabled for the product being sold.
<li> The product must not utilize product options (or at least should not track inventory by product option)
<br>
<Br>
After you have configured your inventory as outlined as above then simply set the powerlister quantity to sell to "-1" (sell infinity).<br>
<br>
When the powerlister channel is created it will reserve zero inventory.
As auctions are launched the powerlister program will change the channel to reserve the total quantity available for sale on eBay.<br><Br>
<b>NOTE:</b> by setting the quantity to sell to "-1" it will implicitly enable the powerlister program to only reserve the actual quantity for sale on eBay - this behavior is effective 12/30/03.<br>
<b>NOTE:</b> If you are NOT tracking inventory, do NOT use set quantity to sell to "-1".  Instead, set this value to "9999" to keep Powerlister running.<br>
<br><br>
If at any time the actual quantity in inventory in the store hits zero the powerlister will exit.
To start the powerlister again you receive more inventory you will need to create another powerlister.<br>
<br>
However if there is not enough inventory in the store to launch,
but the actual quantity is still greater than zero then powerlister will wait (for up to 30 days)
until the inventory is available again, or the actual inventory hits zero.<br>
<br>
This means that to increase the amount powerlister will sell you simply need to update your store inventory.
Powerlisters with -1 in the quantity to sell will not sell more than your store inventory.<br>
<br><br>

<li><b>Important:</b> If you have outstanding offers on Second Chance Offers (Personal Offers), Powerlister considers it an open
auction and will not relist until the auction actually closes.

<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>

Powerlister doesn't check the general inventory setting it checks the product
setting.  If you had inventory enabled on your site, and you disabled it - without disabling it
on the products first it would cause a scenario where Powerlister would think that product inventory
was still enabled and would honor inventory settings, stop listing, and revoke channels based on your
original inventory settings when inventory reached 0.  A workaround to get Powerlister to begin listing again would be to enable inventory 
for the products in question, set an inventory value, save the product information, and then go back and turn inventory
for that product off.
