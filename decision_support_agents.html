<h1>Decision Support Agents</h1>
<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>

Decision Support Agents are an integral part of the Decision Support System (DSS).  

There are three components to the DSS:

<ul>
<li> Data Monitoring & Recording (DMR) - monitors one or more marketplaces, competitors, or other external catalogs
and acquires data that can be used for analysis by humans, or a decision support agent.</li>

<li> Decision Support Agents (DSA) - are small customizable scripts which analyze the data provided to it by the DMR.
The Decision Support Agent can analyze current, and historical data and then choose to perform actions, or not.</li>

<li> Action Execution System (AES) - performs actions in a timely manner as instructed by the DSA.</li>
</ul>

So in a normal configuration one or more DMR's is activated for a product, and in many scenarios if a DSA 
is in use then the product will also be configured to exclude itself from normal pricing and shipping feeds 
to the marketplace. The DMR's monitor the marketplace, or competitors pricing - when a change is detected the
new information is sent to the DSA who performs business logic and renders decisions which are then 
transferred to the AES. 


<h2>DMR: Data Monitoring & Recording</h2>
At this time only an Amazon DMR is available.  Custom DMR's can also be built by any developer who is familiar 
with Javascript. Example programs are provided and can be customized to suite a variety of business needs, and 
specialized versions may also be available for purchase.   Each DMR has a version, and the version is supported
for a period of 1 year from the release date.

<h2>DSA: Decision Support Agents</h2>
Several demo "example" DSA's are provided for reference.  DSA's are small Javascript programs which are
automatically run when new data is acquired by the DMR.

<h2>AES: Action Execution System</h2>
<ul>
<li> logMessage("string") - creates an entry in the developers logbook, for diagnostic and tracing purposes.</li>
<li> makeUpdate("marketplace","verb",{additional:parameters}) - informs the AES to update a marketplace, for example
makeUpdate("AMZ","update",{ price:1.00, shipping:5.95 })</li>
<li> saveNote("msgtype",{additional parameters}) - this </li>
<li> updateProductRecord("attribute","value") - </li>
<li> updateSKURecord("attribute","value") - </li>
<li> playAgainInMinutes(15) - </li>
</ul>



<h1>Example DSA: Nero</h1>
<code>
//
// Nero - the emperor who infamously set rome on fire just so he could watch it burn.
//        this strategy is simple: beat any price, without any regard for safety. 
//

// step1: run 'init'
//        this tells the DSA execution environment to bind release '201320' functions to the context.
//        this is required - if it is omitted, the javascript program will not be able to receive data from the DMR
//        or communicate with the AES.
init(201320);   

// step2:
// at ths point the following objects have been created (by init)
//   a 'dmr' object with historical pricing data
//   a 'sku' object with data about the sku we're 
//
var lowprice = sku.priceAsInt();         // dma stores prices as integers, so we ask SKU for it's price as an Int.
for (var snapshot in dmr.snapshots) {
  if (snapshot.ours == 1) {
    // never price match against ourselves, ain't nobody got time for that.
    }
  else if ((snapshot.msg == "LOW") and (snapshot.mkt == "AMZ")) {
    // the item field holds the price of the item
    var price_of_item = snapshot.item;
    if (lowprice > price_of_item) {
      lowprice = price_of_item - 1;   // remember: currencies are stored as integers so $1.00 = 100
      }
    }
  }

// step3: send the price (if necessary)
if (lowprice == dmr.currentPriceAsInt()) {
  // no need to make updates!
  }
else {
  // now lets go play our fiddle
  makeUpdate("AMZ","update",{"price":lowprice});
  }
