<h2>Overview</h2>
If you have an Internet domain name such as YOURNAME.COM, Zoovy can either host or become the registrar for a domain. Zoovy has three ways of hosting domains. We can host a Store Application (APP), a standard website (WWW.), or a mobile site (m.).  We recommend making Zoovy the registrar for your domains since they will not be allowed to expire while your account is active with us and we do not force you to buy years of hosting up front like other registrars. Websites can also be registered through other registrars with only the content hosted by Zoovy. This is accomplished by pointing your DNS (Domain Name Servers) from that other registrar to Zoovy.
<br>
<aside class="caution">

<div>BEFORE you transfer a domain to Zoovy, you will have to change the primary and secondary domain name servers to:<br>
<br>
<li>primary : ns.zoovy.com  
<li>secondary: ns2.zoovy.com
<br><br>
These changes must be made through the current registrar's user interface. Our technical support staff may be able to assist you with this. Fees may apply for support on non-Zoovy software platforms.<br>
<br>

<h2>Why make Zoovy the registrar?</h2>
We encourage clients make us the registrar of their domain, this puts us in a position to stop myriad fraudulent activities and to ensure continuous DNS service.  We have put together the document: <a class="linkdoc" href="#?doc=50971">Doc 50971</a> to explain this rationale - if you use Godaddy (for example) - it's definitely worth a read.

<section>
<h3>Domain Privacy Policy</h3>
Zoovy does not offer domain privacy because it hurts both email delivery and search engine rankings.  Google has publicly stated it's policy that a company that is engaged in selling to the public should have no need for domain privacy unless it is committing fraud. 
</section>

<section>
<h3>Domain Lock/Unlock Policy</h3>
Zoovy will leave all domains locked unless otherwise requested to by the owner. Requests to unlock domains must be submitted through our electronic support ticketing system.  There is no unassisted method for a site owner to transfer a domain by the owner for security reasons.
</section>

<section>
<h3>Auto-Renew Policy</h3>
Zoovy will register all domains for a period of 1 year at a time, with auto-renew turned on. Domains will not expire unless an electronic support ticket is opened and the customer explicitly requests we terminate services.  
<br>
Domains can be registered for up to 10 years and many experts agree this can slightly help search engine ranking. If you would like us to extend the registration beyond the standard year to year please contact billing@zoovy.com and let us know and we'll be happy to take care of this for you. 
</section>

<section>
<h3>Transfer Policy</h3>
There is no cost to transfer domains aside from any which may be charged by the new registrar.  Accounts which are past due will need to resolve any billing situation prior to any services being rendered (including domain transfer assistance). 
</section>

<section>
<h3>Authentication</h3>
We believe the domain change/transfer/abandon request ticket was opened with malice then Zoovy staff (at our discretion) will attempt to contact the account owner to authenticate the request.  No request will be processed until the account owner can provide sufficient proof that the request was made. Under no circumstances shall Zoovy be liable for failing to properly authenticate a request. 
</section>

<section>
<h3>Abandoned Domain Policy</h3>
Any domain which is not linked with an active account with a monthly billing subscription will be parked.  The merchant is responsible for transferring any domains away from Zoovy prior to terminating services. Domains which are not transferred prior to cessation of Zoovy service shall be considered abandoned by the owner and will immediately become the property of Zoovy, Inc. and will be sold or terminated without any notice.

<h2>Non-Zoovy DNS &amp; Email Policies</h2>

If you choose not to make Zoovy the registrar please review <a class="linkdoc" href="#?doc=50734">Doc 50734</a> which outlines our policies regarding 3rd party dns and email services. 

</article>


<article>
<h2>Recommended Configuration</h2>

We recommend that new accounts be set up as store applications. 
We recommend Google Apps for your email configuration.
We do NOT recommend using a .zoovy.com subdomain, or a .zoovy.net reserve domain as your main shopping application platform. These sites are primarily for temporarily testing a site before it goes live. Once your site has been tested, you need to host it on a domain name of your own and redirect the temporary site to the domain site.

<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>
Do not leave either email or hosting unconfigured.  The interface will let you do this, but the domain will not work.

<aside class="cbc">
<h6></h6>
<div> Steps to configure Email and Hosting for the domain configuration. 
<li> Setup &gt; Domain Hosting &gt; Domain Configuration 
<li> edit configuration 
<li> Use the appropriate domain type drop down menu option (App, WWW., or M.). Call for technical support if you are not sure which kind of domain you should be selecting. You should only select one domain hosting type.<br> 
<li><li> For a Store Application, select Application in the APP: drop down box.
<li><li> For a standard, legacy website, select (VSTORE) Legacy Store.
<li><li> For a mobile site, select (VSTORE) Legacy Store.<br>
<li> EMAIL: Use the drop down menu option to select either Google Apps (recommended), Fusemail, or MX record redirect if you will be sending your email information (MX records) to a third party email host. Note: redirecting email to a third party using MX records is not recommended as any trouble that arises will be on a thrid party software platform our technicians may have never seen. Troubleshooting email issues when an MX record has been selected will likely be billable help. 
<li> When you like your settings, click 'Save configuration.'

If you receive an error message "broked" it means we received some vague error regarding the domain. It does not necessarily mean that there is a problem with the domain. Please test the domain before you open a support ticket.

<h2>Hosting Overview</h2>

Typically with a hosted domain name, the buyer will see the same content stored at yourname.zoovy.com, except at no time will the buyer see the .zoovy.com name (until they get into the secure checkout). This is the recommended method for hosting domains with Zoovy, and is optimal for search engine registration. 

</article>

<article>
<h2>.MOBI OR .TV domain</h2>
We offer the ability to link any .mobi or .tv domain to Zoovy. We DO NOT offer the ability to register a .mobi or .tv domain. Therefore, the domain has to be registered with another  registrar. The name servers will need to changed to ns.zoovy.com and ns2.zoovy.com. </article>

<article>
<h2>Redirection Overview</h2>

Using this method Zoovy will simply perform an HTTP 301 redirect from one domain to another. Configuring a redirect domain is also available for yourname.zoovy.com.
<br>
To appear in the list of destinations a domain must be either currently registered with Zoovy, a new registration, or a domain which is in the process of being transferred to Zoovy. In addition the domain must be configured in either a DEFAULT or SPECIALTY hosting mode.

<h2>Specialty Site Overview</h2>

The specialty site feature allows a single Zoovy store to have multiple "specialty" appearances. Each appearance can utilize a separate site wrapper, have a separate navigation tree, and most importantly have completely separate pricing from the primary site. The specialty site feature is included with the Cross Selling bundle, however in order to have separate pricing you will also need the wholesale bundle. Using the wholesale bundle with separate pricing schedules also means you can have independent promotions, and shipping policies.<br>
<br>

Specialty site pricing is not a substitute for having separate Zoovy stores. There are still situations where a store owner will want to have multiple Zoovy stores. For example all specialty sites share the same "about us", "returns" and "cart pages" (albeit in different site wrappers to keep consistent navigation) - this is either a huge asset, or a giant liability depending on what you're trying to accomplish. 

<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>

If you are trying to intentionally hide the fact that you are the same company -- then specialty site hosting may not be for you. At a very minimum if you intend to hide who you are you'll need to design a custom wrapper which uses alternate about us, contact us, privacy and return pages than a default zoovy store -- or you'll need to omit those features entirely. In addition the cart is shared between all specialty sites and your username.zoovy.com -- so if a customer goes to one and adds an item and then goes to another domain the item from the previous domain will still be there.

</div>
</aside>



In addition, all invoices will have the same company logo. Companies who want to remove all traces of being the same website should plan on utilizing separate Zoovy stores. The specialty site feature is built for customers who want to create multiple presentations for the same store -- with emphasis on different products or product lines.<br>
<br>
It is also a powerful feature as a marketing and branding tool. For example specialty sites allow you to target-market particular demographics with different portions of your inventory. At the same time, it is helping brand your "parent company" as the owner of these sites. It gives you the ability to reach your particular markets individually with a more targeted and efficient presentation. If you require a separate brand, then you should do so by obtaining another Zoovy store. (Of course you can always LAUNCH it with a specialty site, and see if it sells and then separate it out as it's own store later -- since this is an exponentially less expensive approach to maintaining separate Zoovy stores!)<br>
<br>
Examples of appropriate/common usage of specialty site feature:
<li> Multiple sites featuring different product lines all sold from the same parent company. 
<li> Product Line specific site e.g. "www.some-manufacturer-stuff.com", by creating specific sites and having alternate navigation you can bolster search engine rankings. You can also demonstrate a higher level of competence to customers since you have a separate site dedicated to a manufacturer or type of product. Be careful not to use trademarks in your domain name, that can lead to nasty actions from corporate attorneys.
<li>Creative marketing site e.g. www.10-percent-off-my-stuff.com, this is a great way to catch customers attention and do "something different" from your competition. Using this approach it's possible to test marketing campaigns without disrupting your current site. For example putting a "coupon box" on your checkout page is a great way to tell customers who DON'T have a coupon that they aren't getting the best possible price. Using an alternate domain name/limited time site means never having to tell people who would otherwise pay retail that discounts are available. 
<li> Specialty holiday site e.g. www.xmasspecials-from-companyname.com, is again a great way to catch customer's attention. In this case it's also possible to operate these campaigns without disrupting your normal business. This gives you the freedom to be a bit more creative,  and "out of the box" with your ideas which consequently will typically have larger payoffs than your less aggressive "safer" campaigns.

<h2>Delegation to External Sites</h2>

Zoovy provides domain registration and domain hosting. However, we do not allow merchants to provide ad-hoc delegations to other servers running foreign software. 
As part of our responsibility for operating a secure e-commerce site in compliance with PCI rules we believe we should be vigilant to protect our clients from outside threats.  By delegating "A" or "CNAME" records to other hosts those sites have access to the cookies, and other data stored in the browser.  If these services are compromised then the site can be compromised and this presents a very real threat to both our clients, and our brand and reputation. 

<br>

Merchants commonly request subdomains such as forum.domain.com, or ning.domain.com, but we have found in all cases those same merchants are ill equipped (or not even informed) to deal with the security ramifications associated with allowing user generated content such as blogs, or forum postings to appear under their domain name. Virtually all merchants will be in violation of their Merchant Account Provider guidelines by allowing user generated content (commonly associated with forums, blogs and social networks) to be co-mingled with the same domain name associated with their store. 

<br>

Blogs and forums provide excellent attack vectors for a variety of XSS attacks.  We recommend merchants use a separate domain name for their blogs and forums to avoid the potential for XSS attacks on their site. 

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
Zoovy will reconsider this policy on a case by case basis provided a merchant can demonstrate they have adequate security counter-measures. 
Please understand any type of security breach (through our fault our not) that is associated with one of our stores can cause significant damage to our reputation, and that of our other clients as well.

<h2>Linking between specialty stores</h2>

When adding links within the text area and textbox in the website builder, it's important to use the proper linking convention.  It's important to make sure the cart gets passed between stores or it will shared.  To set up a link in the content of a page, use this syntax:

<aside class="html">
<h6></h6>
<code>

<a href="http://www.DOMAINNAME.com%CART%/">This text is linked</a>

</code>
</aside>



For linking within the same store, use WIKI. If html is needed, use this syntax:

<aside class="html">
<h6></h6>
<code>

<a href="%SESSION%category/category.safe.name">This text is linked</a>

</code>
</aside>



If you want to put a link to another specialty store into a TOXML file (like a theme), follow these instructions:

<br>

Add the following element to your TOXML file, just below the CONFIG element.
<aside class="html">
<h6></h6>
<code>

<ELEMENT TYPE="TEXT" SUB="SESSION_ID" ID="SESSIONID" DEFAULT="%CART%" FONT="0" ID="CART_VAR_4SESSION"></ELEMENT>

</code>
</aside>


Then format your links as follows in the html of the document:<br>
<a href='http://www.yourdomain.com%CART/'>Linking is great fun</a>
