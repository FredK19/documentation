<h1>Website / Image Library / Upload from Disk</h1>
<article>
<h2>Step by Step</h2>

Getting Started:
<li> Uploading pictures from an existing website is very easy. 
<li> First record the URL for the image you wish to upload, typically you can do this by right click on any image in your browser and selecting "Properties" this will give you either the HTTP or HTTPS for a specific image.
<li> Click the "Upload new Image" link in the upper left hand corner of any of the Zoovy Image Library pages, this will change the page to the upload picture page.
<li> Type the URL into URL box at the bottom of the screen.
<li> Press the "Upload From URL" button, this will transfer the file to Zoovy.
<li> If the transfer is successful the image will be stored in a folder that begins with the first letter of the filename, so Pretty.gif would be stored in the "P" directory, and so on. You will be given the option to review the file after it has been uploaded.

<h2>Question: What formats are allowed?</h2>

The only supported image formats are PNG, JPG, and GIF.
Some older browsers do not support the PNG format, however most modern browsers work without issue.

JPG's must be saved in RGB format. Some JPG's are stored in CMYK for print work and are
not compatible with most web browsers or the Zoovy Image Library.
