[[SECTION]Testing]
If you don't own an iPhone - you can use: http://www.testiphone.com/ to simulate what your site would look like on an iPhone.  

[[HINT]]
Testiphone.com is a free site, not hosted by zoovy - there are some subtle differences between it, and a real iPhone. For example the interface is intended to be navigated on a touch screen, without a mouse. This is why the buttons and links are formatted differently than a regular phone.

[[SECTION]Device Compatibility]

[[SUBSECTION]iPhone]
The mobile sites are built with the iPhone interface in mind. iPhone's hold a substantial lead in the "Smart 'web' Phone" units shipped (1.5 million domestically in 2009). 
But the most impressive statistic is consistently over 95% of the "regular web surfers on mobile devices" are using iPhones.  In addition iPhone owners tend to be more affluent, and "geeky" due primarily to the $99/mo. service plan.

[[HINT]]
For this reason we believe that nearly all future phones which hope to gain any reasonable market-share will need to mimic the features/behaviors of the iPhone.
[[/HINT]]

For this reason we will not be making any changes to the wrappers which would diminish the iphone experience (even if that means sacrificing compatibility with other phones).

[[/SUBSECTION]]

[[SUBSECTION]Google/Android Phones]
The stock wrapper(s) have been tested and are compatible. 
[[/SUBSECTION]]

[[SUBSECTION]Blackberry]
The stock wrapper(s) have been tested and are compatible. 
[[HINT]]
Although the website renders and is navigable the blackberry's default internal browser does not translate many of the images. For this reason we believe most blackberry surfers are very accustomed to navigating sites with no images.  
[[/HINT]]

[[SUBSECTION]Verizon enV]
The stock wrapper(s) have been tested and are compatible.
