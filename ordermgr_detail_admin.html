<h1>Zoovy Order Manager Setup</h1>
<article>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>

Zoovy Order Manager allows you to setup preferences, special payment types, add users and much more.  For now we will concentrate on setting up the basics to get started.
</article>
<article>
<h2>Tools</h2>

Under the drop down tools menu you will find general information, email manager, and label setup.  There are other options here, but lets focus on general information and label setup. 
</article>
<article>
<h2>General Information</h2>

The general information tab allows you to modify and save company information which was downloaded from web manager during synchronization. 
You can edit company address, phone numbers and contact information under the admin menu. Just select edit company information and make your updates there.  When you synchronize with your Zoovy website and changes are uploaded to web manager.

<h2>Preferences</h2>

You can delete either custom or authorized Zoovy payment types. When you delete a payment type it will
NOT appear in the list of accepted payment types when a user is editing an order. BE CAREFUL, when
you delete a payment type that appears in an active order the payment type of the order will remain
unchanged BUT any editing that occurs to the payment information of that order will result in the
payment type being lost, and an employee will be unable to change it back to the original (now
invalid/removed) payment type.

<h2>Adding a User</h2>

You can add users to your Zoovy system. Users have the ability to edit orders, send email, process
payments, print invoices, etc. in fact they can do everything EXCEPT login to your Zoovy account
and change your store. This protects your business against un-authorized changes.

<h2>Change Admin Password</h2>

The administrator password should ALWAYS be the same as your Zoovy account. You should only change
this if you have also changed the password on the Zoovy server.

<h2>Company Synchronization</h2>

You can load your company information such as Name, Address, Zip Code, Phone Number and
logo from your website. Normally you will not need to edit this information, this function
is really only useful if your first attempt to synchronize fails.
</article>

<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>

Company Synchronization for Order Manager is DOWNLOAD ONLY which means
any changes you make in the Order Manager to your company information (e.g. phone number, company name, etc.) WILL NOT appear on the website.

</div>

<h2>Company Setup</h2>

Company Setup allows you to modify and save the information downloaded from the website. For
example if you have a PO Box that you use then consider using the PO Box mailing address on the Order client and the Physical location on the Website so customers
can visit your store.

<article>
<h2>Company Logo</h2>

NOTE: The company logo entered will NOT be uploaded to your the Website it will ONLY be used
for printing invoices.
</article>
<article>
<h2>Company Logo</h2>

Normally the Order Management client will download the company logo from your website. Because
the logo used in the order management client will appear on invoices it is recommended that you
change the logo to one that is more suitable for printing. Logos can be in either BMP, GIF, and
JPEG, ICO and CUR format. The image will be scaled to approximately 140 x 140 pixels and should have either
a transparent or white background for best printing results.
</article>
<article>
<h2>Preferences</h2>

In the preferences areas you can permit users to edit recent orders (not recommended).<br>
You can also configure the Invoice Footer Message which is displayed at the bottom of each
invoice and packing slip.
</article>
<article>
<h2>Reset Database</h2>

The Reset Database tool is a maintenance tool that allows you to destroy all
local information and completely clear your database. By doing this it will cause the Order
Manager client to automatically download all of your information from the Zoovy servers. Using
this tool will cause you to lose any changes you have made since the last syncrhonization.
You should not use this tool unless instructed to by Zoovy technical support.
