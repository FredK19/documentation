[[SECTION]Objections]
Q: I don't have a problem with hackers on my site.<br>
A: A lot of our clients originally felt that way, but realized that the concern about hackers was bigger than they thought -- and having us verify the web server security (market the strength of your security) to their visitors with the HACKER SAFE certification it actually increased their online orders.  Your customers will feel more comfortable in using their credit card online.

[[BREAK]]

O:	It costs too much.<br>
A:	You'll find that a larger percentage of your website visitors become buyers after your site is certified as HACKER SAFE, your investment in the service can pay for itself many times over. (With the HACKER SAFE certification on the site, it really turns the cost of security into a revenue generator)

[[BREAK]]


Q: The term "HACKER" might scare customers<br>
A: HACKER SAFE is seen on over 75,000 sites and used by many top sites such as: PetCo, Cabelas, Sony, GMC, and the AmericanRedCross.  These sites CHOSE ScanAlert because they know the certification works and shoppers trust sites that are HACKER SAFE.

[[BREAK]]


Q: The term "HACKER SAFE" might make me a target for hackers<br>
A: None of the sites that are certified as HACKER SAFE have ever been compromised.  Hackers are criminals and they like easy targets.  If a burglar were to rob a house, he would probably choose a house that doesn't have an alarm, bars, etc.  Hackers tend to stay away HACKER SAFE sites.

[[BREAK]]

Q: It will take too long and will cause more work<br>
A: Implementation is simple.  Just one line of HTML to cut-and-and paste to your site... IT professionals find that our service makes their job a lot easier -- we identify the vulnerabilities and provide the patch solutions.   With the HACKER SAFE certification on the site, it really turns the cost of security into a revenue generator.
