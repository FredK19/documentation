<h1>Order Manager 5.xxx Release Notes</h1>
<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>

This document outlines the version to version changes in the order manager windows client.
</article>
<article>
<h2>Build 5.146 - released 1/24/06</h2>


This version includes several bug fixes for Endicia and Quickbooks. The most significant feature enhancement in this 
version is the ability to print dropship packingslips for wholesale customers. 
A drop ship packing slip includes the wholesale customers address and logo on the packing slip 
(so when it is received by the recipient they think it was shipped by your customer, instead of you.) Dropship 
packing slips do not include price information either, and include the reference number given by your customer on 
the invoice. A dropship packing slip is automatically printed anytime an order is received from a customer who has 
drop shipping information in their customer record. (The ability to add drop shipping information to a customer 
record requires the wholesale bundle.)
