<h2>Overview</h2>

This tutorial covers "Advanced Shipping" in it we will discuss some techniques for designing 
and maintaining a customized shipping schedule. <br>

In reality shipping is probably one of the biggest pain in the necks you'll have 
to deal with, so if you can get through this the rest will be cake ;-). I should
point out that you are not alone and you do not need to do this by yourself, in 
fact Zoovy provides e-commerce consulting through its fast track and technical 
support dept's with specialists who do this stuff all the time. Believe me having 
a Pro sit down for an hour and work through the specific issues for your products 
and simply give you a concise summary can in many cases save you tens if not hundreds 
of hours of frustration. So with all that having been said - enjoy!

<h2>Managing Customer Expectations</h2>

When configuring shipping we must always remind ourselves that while is important 
to have accurate shipping polices, sometimes it is even more important to manage 
the customers expectations when it comes to shipping. In many cases having a simple 
to explain or even flat rate shipping policy which is easy to explain can help 
your sales ESPECIALLY if you are planning to use Auctions. Auction users are very 
wary of shipping costs. In any case sometimes it is better to quote a higher price, 
but explain how you arrived at a price, this gives the customer a warm and fuzzy 
feeling which will keep them coming back over and over again. If you have not 
already selected a shipping provider, you should be aware that each shipping vendor 
carries a lot of weight for your business (pardon the pun). For example there 
is a general perception that FedEx is faster and more reliable than their competitors 
at UPS or USPS, however there is also a stigma that they are also much more expensive. 
While in reality if you do any volume at all, you can usually get Fedex to discount 
down to a point where it is competitive with UPS and USPS. But the reality is 
that each major shipping company spends millions and millions of marketing dollars 
each year to carve out a niche for themselves. You can use their marketing dollars 
to help your customers understand what kind of business you are and most important 
you should always make sure your customers associate your company with the shipping 
vendors marketing policy. For example if you're competitive edge is selling things 
at a discount, you will probably want to use either the United States Postal Service 
(USPS) or United Parcel Service Ground (UPS) since they are perceived as being 
less expensive and therefore would match the customers expectations of your products. 
If you sell high ticket items which are very lightweight you should consider using 
Federal Express, or UPS AIR to get your items to your customers as quickly as 
possible, and in the best condition possible. This might seem trivial, but believe 
me when I say it makes a huge difference in the customers perception of your company. 
Remember the shipping agent is the ONLY human they are likely to associate with 
your product (Yes - it scares me too, especially after some of the stories I've 
heard.) Another thing to remember is that (as a rule) when people order products 
online they expect them to magically appear the next day, at a minimum the customer 
LIKES to be able to track an order. So either set the customers expectations BEFORE 
they purchase, or suffer the wrath afterward. For this reason I usually recommend 
selecting a primary shipping vendor who provides tracking numbers for all orders, 
Fedex and UPS both do a good job of this. Unless of course you're entire business 
model is built around the "low-frills" discount experience in which case you'll 
probably end up using the USPS which doesn't have any real tracking to speak of 
(other than order confirmation of course). I can't stress how much having real 
tracking numbers can help your repeat business. One more thing you should always 
try to ship orders within at least 2-3 days of receiving the order, if you can't 
ship within 2-3 days let the customer know ahead of time. The last item is if 
you do not ship the same day you receive the order then DO NOT offer next day 
service (offer 2-3 day econo-saver instead). For some unknown reason when people 
select Overnight service the package MUST arrive the next day or else you'll hear 
about it, they'll want you eat the shipping costs, and in some cases they'll still 
complain to their family and friends, which means you'll likely miss out on future 
sales opportunities.

<h2>Shipping Insurance</h2>

You can add insurance to checkout by simply adding the amount to your handling. 
If you are using simple or fixed price shipping and you want to provide both an 
insured and an un-insured rate then you will need to configure two shipping methods, 
one with insurance and one without. If you are using USPS, FedEx, or UPS the insurance 
options vary by carrier.
