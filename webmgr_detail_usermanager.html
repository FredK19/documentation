<h1>Manage User Logins</h1>
<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>






Manage User Logins allows an administrative user to create sub-accounts for employees and specify which portions of this site each employee may access. 
Throughout this document the term "Master Account" or "Master User" refers to logging in to Zoovy without any specific user.
The master account cannot be deleted, and always implicitly contains administrative priviledges. 

All User Accounts are created by first logging into the Master Account. 
The Master Account is always the same as the Zoovy store name. 
For example if the Zoovy store name is "ACMEINC" and is located at http://acmeinc.zoovy.com then the Master User is simply "ACMEINC".

<br>


If the Master User creates 3 separate employee logins for Phil, Bob, and Sharon then those logins would be "ACMEINC*PHIL", "ACMEINC*BOB",
and "ACMEINC*SHARON" respectively. Each User account should have a different password than the Master Account. 
Access to the Master Account should be limited only to the business owner, or primary account contact for Zoovy. 
When adding a new user you can select which privileges that user needs to complete their job.
Trusted employees can be given "Is Administrator" access (discussed later) so they do not need to login to the Master Account.

<h2>What is this and why did this change?</h2>

<i>If there is one thing constant in business, it's change.</i><br>
<br>
As the sophisitication of Zoovy has continued to advance, the profiles of businesses using Zoovy has changed as well.
An overwhemling majority of Zoovy customers have multiple employees who access the Zoovy account on a daily basis. 
With this comes the need to track who is logging in, and what they are doing while they are logged in. <br>
<br>
This feature will make both our customers, and Zoovy operate more efficiently. Here's what this does for you:<br>

<li> <b>Accountability</b> - under the old system, it was impossible to tell which employee made changes to things like inventory. 
This means tracking down mistakes after happened, and more importantly taking steps to prevent them in the future was pretty much impossible.
If the employee who made the mistake can be easily identified so they can be made aware, and then properly trained as to how to use
the system to prevent future issues - it will save customers hours of frustration trying to figure out how mistakes happen.
Ultimately this translates into savings of thousands dollars in lost productivity by being able to more quickly identify mistakes and correct them.

<li> <b>Reduced Errors</b> - as we've learned with our Enterprise customers, as soon as employees know that a detailed log is available
of all their actions their productivity increases, and they also make fewer mistakes. 
As absurd as this sounds, it's seems everybody tends to doublecheck their work when they know any mistake will swifty and immediately 
end up back on their desk. 

<li> <b>Better Support</b> - Zoovy support currently spends more than half our day tracing down what eventually end up being 
determined are employee errors. 
The auditing makes it easier than ever to identify when changes happen and who made them - thereby assisting us in providing
all customers with faster and more accurate support.
This also means that Zoovy staff has more time to spend doing stuff that actually benefits you such as improving documentation, 
and adding features. Even if you don't have multiple users - this change will have an impact on you!

<li> <b>Reduced Exposure</b> - Using the account manager you can restrict employees to specific areas of the site that are necessary to do their
jobs, and nothing more. This reduces you and your customers exposure to threats from disgrunted employees. It also makes it easier to 
terminate employees because you only need to suspend their account - you don't need to change everybodies password. 

<li> <b>Contractor Access</b> - Do you have an SEO firm, or website designer who is working with you and needs temporary access to your site?
You can set expirations on logins so you don't have to worry about removing them later. 
Plus since the expiration is displayed when they login, they know they better finish the project on time or else!

<li> <b>Increased Productivity</b> - in the past, in multi-user configurations anytime somebody accidentally pressed the logout button everybody 
would be logged out -- this resulted in hours of lost work every week. 

<li> <b>Enhanced Security</b> - because only one person may access an account at the same time, Zoovy is now able to expire authentication tokens
quicker (every 24 hours) thereby closing the gap where a person could attempt to fraudulently access your account. 
It also means that users can actually use the logout button which ensures if their computer or laptop is accidentally stolen, that the 
thief won't have access to their business. 
<br>
<br>
Planned Enhancements:<br>

<li> <b><i>Required Training:</i></b> In the future when creating new accounts new employee will be prohibited from accessing
a specific area of functionality until AFTER they've completed the requisite self-paced multimedia training, and successfully completed a short 
competency test afterwards (this is optional, but recommended). 
These multimedia training videos will be provided free of charge to all customers, and we hope they will dramatically reduce training costs 
for new employees.

<li> <b><i>Multi-Account Login:</i></b> For customers with multiple stores with Zoovy - in the future this feature will also allow specific employees 
to seamlessly move between stores.

<h2>Creating Users</h2>

Creating users is easy, just go to Setup / My Account Settings / Manager User Logins. From there click the "Add New User" link, you will need to provide the following
information:<br>
<li> Login Name: maximum 10 characters, consisting of letters A-Z and 0-9, the user will login STORE*LOGIN -- so if your Zoovy username is "ACME" and 
you create user "BOB" then on the zoovy homepage the login would be "ACME*BOB"
<li> Password: create a password for the user, if you enter the password of "password", or leave the field blank then the user will be prompted to 
change the password after their first login.
<li> Full Name: The individuals Full Name, or Nick Name this will eventually be displayed to customers when emails are sent by this user.
<li> Job Title: This will be included as part of the upcoming "Signature" feature, and will also be included as a part of a Virtual Card for emails sent.
<li> Email: This is the email address that you would like Zoovy to send email *FROM* and *TO* when this user is working in the account. 
<li> Phone: This phone number is included in the Virtual Card attachment in emails (so cellphones are probably a bad idea)
<li> Is Administrator: This grants the user all the same priviledges as the Master Account, EXCEPT the ability to add/remove the Administrator flag from other accounts.
<li> Is Customer Service: (NOTE: This feature is NOT YET IMPLEMENTED but will be relased in Q1 2005)
Emails sent to the designated customer service email will be sent in a round robin fashion to an employee. 
The advantage of this is it means multiple customer service people don't need to share a single email address.
You can configure this feature now, it will start working once the feature is released.

<li> Expires: Enter a MM/DD/YY format date that the account should become inactive. Use this to give limited time access to contractors. 
DO NOT USE THIS TO TERMINATE EMPLOYEES - since the date the account will expire is displayed to the user when they login.
