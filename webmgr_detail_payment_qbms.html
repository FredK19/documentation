<h2>Transaction Integration</h2>


The QuickBooks Merchant Services solution provides integration within the workflow of QuickBooks.  
For example, the transaction information for a particular item (customer 
date, card number, item purchased, amount) is automatically uploaded in 
real time as a Sales Receipt or an Invoice, and this is then stored 
within QuickBooks.  Other gateway solutions are not integrated into the workflow 
and require the user to import information.  This increases accuracy 
and saves time.
