<h1>Site Builder - Page Editor</h1>

<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>
You can get to the page editor by going to Setup / Website Builder - from there you will be able to edit your about us, shopping cart, gallery, return policy, privacy policy, and any other page you want to (including your category pages). The only pages on your site that you cannot edit directly from the website builder is the product pages, which are edited directly from the product itself in the online product editor.

<h2>Product Layout Properties - Detailed Description</h2>
Detailed descriptions are descriptions that are NOT the same as your product description.
Some of the standard page layouts include a detailed description, which can be different
than your product description. This is especially useful if you want to have one thing
which appears in your auctions, and another which appears on your site. Or if you
want one thing to appear in your product list (e.g. a non-HTML version of the
product list) and another which appears on the actual product page.

<h2>Configuring a Product List</h2>

You can configure your products to appear as thumbnails by selecting a thumbnail product list in the website builder. 

To configure simply go to Setup | Website Builder | click the edit link for the page you want to have thumbnails. Finally select [Edit] link next to the product list, then change the layout to thumbnail and select how many columns you want.

<h2>Layouts with Multiple Product Lists and/or specialty store homepages</h2>

Some layouts support multiple product lists.  To utilize this feature, you must first create 'lists' in the categories and lists interface, then select them in the site builder.

You may be asking yourself "Self, why don't they remove the 'products' link from the other prodlist elements?"  The answer is because this method gives you the opportunity to have prodlist 1 reference a 'list' and prodlist 3 reference the default homepage products. It's more versatile this way.  Especially since there are other system implications for how the products on the homepage are used (ex: related items).

<h2>Page Properties - Title and Description</h2>

At the top of the page editor in the website builder, there is a button for page properties.  In this area, you can modify the page title, description and keywords, so as to optimize your site for search engine registration.  Changing the description and keywords area will not effect how this page appears to your customers.  However, the page title is displayed in most themes/wrappers to the customer, plus it is used at the top of the browser itself.

<div>When using the "Live Preview" functionality to preview your edits to that page layout, you may encounter that the browser's "Back" button simply reloads the preview.  To get back you will need to double click the "Back" button to get you back to the page layout.  Alternately, if you right click on the "Live Preview" link, you can either open the preview in another window, or in another tab window, which will allow you to modify the layout and still see your results. (You will just need to "Refresh" the preview window between modifications.)
