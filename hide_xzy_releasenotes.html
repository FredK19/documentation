<h2>What happened from version 1.50 to 6.000</h2>
So back in February 2006 we stopped development on the warehouse manager to focus on migrating the Order Manager desktop client to the same .Net platform that Warehouse Manager was built on. 
Although we originally expected this process to take "about 6-8 weeks", it actually took closer to 11 months to work out all the kinks. 

<br>
<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>If you are getting the following error message, you will not be able to use Warehouse Manager version 6.000. We will be releasing another version of warehouse manager that will resolve this issue. <br>This error message will usually occur either when downloading products or Website Category Download: <b>System.Data.OleDb.OleDbException: The field is too small to accept the amount of data you attempted to add.  Try inserting or pasting less data.</b> <br>If you get this error message when warehouse manager is downloading products, most likely this is due to the Amazon attributes are greater than 30 characters.<br>It is important that you open a support ticket for this issue anyway. When the new version of order manager that contains the fix for this error is released we will be able to notify you.
</div>

For the layperson version 6.000 will not appear substantially different from it's predecessor 1.50, however there is quite a big different "under the hood". 
Many of the components such as login/security/licensing/data synchronization/database format/shared utility libraries are the same for both Warehouse Manager and Order Manager, this means any changes/enhancements in those libraries only needs to be implemented once to benefit both software applications. 

<br>

This is of importance because now going forward both software applications can be worked on by the same people, in a common language, and will (in the future) be able to share data much easier, without compatibilty issues since the pieces can be used interchangibly. They are also both fully Vista Ready, and will be able to take full advantage of all future generation dual and quad core processors.  Not to mention that having a shared library of sync routines facilitates the release of additional specialized desktop software (such as the Enteprise Sync Manager) to suite complex customer environments.
