Add it to your cart without adding a prescription.
Raphael wants all the options that show up to NOT show up if no prescription is added.  To do this, Brian needs to make changes to the way options works so that 'options are optional' and if not selected, they don't show up.

Hello,

Brian and I made good progress on this today.  There is now support for 'optional options' so they can be configured to not show up in the cart.

I still need to reconfigure the prescription piece to use this technology. I should be able to get this started in the next two days.

####### TECH NOTES

Have this mostly working.  All items are no longer showing up in the cart except for the checkboxes.  There's an issue here because if I don't pass pog_AN or pog_AN_cb then the cart thinks it wasn't passed and it doesn't show up.  If I set it to 0 or NO, it shows up as a NO in the cart.

need Brian help.

Hello,

The new prescription chooser features are enabled.  Now, if no prescription is set for a given item, none of the fields will show up in the cart.  Likewise, if a specific option in the prescription chooser is not set, it will (in most cases) not show up.

Hello,

10 reasons banner is added to the left column of the store.  You can change what banners appear in the left column by going into the theme editor. All the banners I've created are in the 'banners' folder of your media library.

added top ten to bottom of auction template with your updates to the text.
amex added to footer of auction template.

In the future, you can use this ticket for all change requests regarding the website, auction template and prescription chooser.  Putting the requests here will route them directly to me and get them into the work queue quicker. Changes to the 'widget' that is being built should not be asked here as that's liz's project.

Hello,

contact - loads automatically from the company information page, plus there is an editable region above that.  I can turn off the 'load from company info' fields if you want.

You can edit the policies, including the contact text, through setup - profiles - edit auction settings (click on the auction template id).

1. working on this...
2.  phone numbers are against ebay policy.

Hi JT,

I have had multiple people tell me that the Brand logo buttons on the left of the homepage are NOT search engine friendly, if your answer to this is correct, Then can we create regular buttons on the bottom of the home page that are also clickable and route to the same address these will be read by the search engine while our image brands will make is cosmetically friendly for our shoppers?

I went to competers website and all of them use regular buttons that when you scroll over it reads you the brand of the button. The only website that does it both ways is decormyeyes.com he has the regular buttons on the left and the image buttons on the right. 

What do you think of this idea ????

Hello,

To have an in depth discussion between the seo value of having linked images vs linked text, you'll need to chat with someone in our marketing department (they're more knowledgeable). They'll also know the value/harm of having the same page linked to twice in your theme.  I can have someone reach out to you if you'd like.

What I did do that I think will help is the following:

I added a 'title' attribute to the link on each of the brand images so that, when moused over, the brand name appears in FireFox.  The title tag is also 'supposed' to be search engine friendly (nobody knows for sure). The alt tag, which was already present, is what controls the rollover behavior in Explorer.

In addition, I linked the brands header to the 'shop by brand' page so that the search engines could get to a list of all your brands in a format that includes both the picture and the text.
http://www.eyeglassliquidators.com/category/shop_by_brand/

I also verified that the brands page is visible so it appears in your google sitemap feed.

Thanks,

JT

<h2>Resolution</h2>
Thank you for linking everything.

we would like to redesign the product page itself.

This will pertain to the items that HAVE the prescription chooser ON. 

1)We would like the "INCLUDED - FEATURES - CUSTOMER REVIEW" Field to be above the prescription chooser field.

2) Right under "INCLUDED - FEATURES - CUSTOMER REVIEW" Field we want a rectangular banner to say "Need RX prescription lenses? fill out the form bellow" this banner can be as wide as the field above and below. we want the "RX" word to be like the medical rx. i have attached a picture. 
3)below the "need rx" banner we want our prescription chooser field.

The reason of this change is because the prescription field is right below the buy now button and it seems that you have to fill it out. We want it to look optional because only 5% of shoppers want there RX filled. 

Jt if you have any advise to make it look better please feel free as you know our goal. Thanks

Hi JT,

I have hired a writier to write intro's to the brands we sell. These intros will help us get organic results on search engines. We need to create footers on the bottom of the home page, right under the Home, Store policies, etc.....

it could be the same format and all. we have created the first page it is saved under categories and lists " !tom-ford-sunglasses ". 

can you please tell me the cost of this (adding buttons to the bottom). Please understand that there will be a lot of buttons (one for each brand) and it must be cost efficient.

Please let me know thank you once again JT

Hello,

If you create a category called something like 'brand descriptions' and then create all your brand text pages as subcategories of that, I can easily add an element that will list all the brands.  When you add new brand description pages, they'll get added to the footer automatically.

Have you talked to Christy about what the seo impact will be for these pages?
