<h1>Order Manager: Payment Types</h1>

<article>
<h2>Payment Types</h2>
OrderManager can support a number of payment types, by default it will support only payment types defined by your Zoovy checkout. The client administrator can add custom payment types to keep more accurate track of the different types of payment.

<h2>Adding a Payment Type</h2>

Use the Add Payment Type function to have new payment types appear in Order Edit. payment types may either be a valid payment code as recognized by the Zoovy system, or may be a custom payment type used internally by your company. It is important to remember that new payment types will only appear in the Order Manager client and will NOT appear on the website.

<h2>Delete a Payment Type</h2>

You can delete either custom or authorized Zoovy payment types. When you delete a payment type it will NOT appear in the list of accepted payment types when a user is editing an order. BE CAREFUL, when you delete a payment type that appears in an active order the payment type of the order will remain unchanged BUT any editing that occurs to the payment information of that order will result in the payment type being lost, and an employee will be unable to change it back to the original (now invalid/removed) payment type.
