<h2>Firewalls</h2>

You may need to set your firewall rules or permissions up for Order Manager.  Order Manager needs to be able to receive and send data to and from the website in order to work.
How to do this will depend on your firewall or router software.  Please try a google search if you are unsure how to configure your firewall sofware with rules or permissions.
We can begin a list of instructions for each brand if you send them to us.
