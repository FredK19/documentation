<h1>Inventory Updates</h1>
<article>
<h2>Create a Spreadsheet</h2>




Using the CSV import utility in Setup/CSV Import Utility/Inventory makes it possible to update your inventory with a simple spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel.  The format for this file is simple.  In the first row of the first column place %SKU, in the second column first row, place %INVENTORY.
On each subsequent row of the spreadsheet you will put the actual SKU or product ID and the actual inventory count.

<h2>Import</h2>

<li>To import your updated inventory, go to Setup -> CSV Import Utility and select Inventory.  If you are simply performing an update, do not select the options.
<li>Next locate the CSV file you created by using the browse button.  
<li>Hit the load from CSV file button.

<h2>Incremental update through CSV</h2>

You can now update your inventory incrementally in bulk through CSV.  The process is a lot like the standard import, with a few modifications to the final file.
Incremental updating allows you to add or subtract numbers from your current standing inventory numbers.  For instance, if you have a product with 10 currently in stock, your CSV can add 3  to it, or subtract 3 depending on what you want done.  You can add and subtract for each line item in the CSV.
<br>
The necessary change to the actual file is to add the header "#INCREMENTAL=1" to line one, moving your standard headers %SKU,%INVENTORY to line 2. "=1" being on "=0" or leaving the header out all together is off (standard import).
<br>
Your CSV should look like this:
<br>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td valign='top' nowrap>#INCREMENTAL=1</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign='top' nowrap>%SKU</td>
		<td valign='top' nowrap>%INVENTORY</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign='top' nowrap>PRODUCT1</td>
		<td valign='top' nowrap>-3</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign='top' nowrap>PRODUCT2</td>
		<td valign='top' nowrap>+24</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign='top' nowrap>PRODUCT3</td>
		<td valign='top' nowrap>+5</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<br>
No particular options are necessary when importing this file.  Select Inventory import for CSV import utility, browse for your file and load.  The default option (user specified headers) should work fine.

<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>
This import WILL modify all SKUs listed.  If a value does not specify + or -, it will default to a + and add the given number to your inventory.  Only list the SKUs you want to effect.

<h2>Options</h2>

There are two options available for the CSV Inventory import:
<li>Enable inventory for each SKU imported<br>
This should only be done on a first time import.  As it sounds, it will enable inventory tracking for each product that is imported.  If the product does not exist, it will create a blank product and enable inventory.  Specifically this will go through and set the zoovy:inv_enable field on each product to 1. If the product has a dash in the SKU, it will set the item to 2.  NOTE: product options are identified with dashes.
<li>Strip Dashes from SKU field<br>
  This is a handy feature if you receive inventory lists from drop shippers who 
  use dashes in their SKU's. Just name your product ID's to be the same as the 
  SKU's, but substitute underscores _ for the dashes -. Create one product for 
  each item, then when you import simply check the box and the SKU will be translated 
  from ABC-123 to ABC_123. This can greatly simplify your ordering process if 
  your SKU's match that of your drop shipper.

<h2>Product Manager Inventory</h2>

  The Zoovy Product Manager will incrementally update your inventory unless you 
  check absolute inventory to change what the number on the website is. It is 
  important to realize that Product Manager is incremental because it works offline. 
  For example, if you synchronize product manager, it says the inventory of product 
  X is 10. Then you sell 3 items to the business next door without creating a 
  Zoovy order. So you go into Product Manager and adjust the quantity to 7. This 
  will subtract 3 from the quantity on the website. This keeps you from unknowingly 
  changing the quantity to a wrong number because orders have been placed for 
  the item. When your numbers don't match and you sync, Product Manager will give 
  you a notice.
