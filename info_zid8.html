<h2>Deployment Options</h2>

<section>
<h3>Standalone</h3>
Standalone is suited for small companies with only one station processing orders and is included free with most accounts.
</section>

<section>
<h3>Network</h3>
Suited for companies needing multiple concurrent or non-concurrent users, requires one PC to be designated as the "server", and not used for normal operations.  $50/mo. added to monthly minimum + additional per user fees which vary depending on account type.  
</section>

<section>
<h3>Internet</h3>
Currently undergoing testing.  We plan to eventually release a hosted server solution titled "Internet Deployment" for geographically distributed companies, requires renting a server on the Internet to host the database.  Internet will be available in 2009.  Pricing To Be Determined. Please let us know if you are interested in participating in a pilot. We expect the server leases to be approximately $100/mo. for a basic server.

<h3>Sync Manager</h3>
This application is for network installs and runs on the Network Server as a service and transmits changes and receives updates automatically once every hour.

You can use any workstation as a server, however for high volume deployments (+300 orders per day), or a lot of concurrent users we recommend a dedicated server. Contact Zoovy Support for our current recommendations about a dedicated server.

<h3>Database Engine</h3>
The Database Engine stores your data. Each supported database engine has it's own performance characteristics and licensing models. Standalone installations use a Microsoft Access database exclusively.  Network installations can choose between MySQL 5.1 and Microsoft SQL Server 2008. 
<br>
Sync Manager, and each of the clients connect to the database engine. Each of the clients also connects directly to the database engine using TCP/IP in a true client/server model.

<h2>Support Options</h2>

<section>
<h3>Basic Support</h3>
Included with all accounts, support during normal business hours. Installation/Upgrade appointments should be scheduled via the support interface and will be billed as an hourly SOP (System Operations). 

<aside class="caution">
<h6></h6>
<div>
If you choose to upgrade without the assistance of Zoovy Support and miss-configure or corrupt your database. The troubleshooting and repair time can easily surpass the amount of time a tech would spend installing the upgrade properly. This time would definitely be billable as well. 
</div>
</aside>
<br>

Keep in mind that the higher volume your stores will take more time to install the upgrade. Please schedule when you can have Order Manager down for multiple hours.
<br><br>

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
Technically savvy clients may choose to perform unassisted upgrades at their own risk. Emergency/escalated support rates apply for assistance during non-business business hours.  Standalone upgrades can be done unassisted.
