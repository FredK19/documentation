<h1>Shipping Bundle Overview</h1>

<article>
<h2>Shipping Bundle Purpose</h2>







The Shipping Bundle allows you to accomplish a variety of special scenarios with the way you calculate your shipping. If you calculate all of your domestic shipping one way and all of your international shipping another way, odds are you will not need the Shipping Bundle. It is when exceptions or special handling or insurance options come into play that the Shipping Bundle becomes necessary.

<h2>Is the Shipping Bundle right for you?</h2>
It depends on how you calculate your shipping. A very simple shipping scenario, such as flat rate shipping, is easy to accomplish and will not require the Shipping Bundle. It is when you start having special exceptions that rules and the Shipping Bundle may become necessary.

<div>Do you calculate your shipping differently for the non-continental United States? Do you want to calculate FedEx or UPS in some situations and others rates, such as USPS, in other situations? Do you want to offer a coupon code that gives free shipping? These are all examples of when you might need the Shipping Bundle.
