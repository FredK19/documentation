Zoovy syndication sends products to Amazon in batches of up to 100. If there is an XML error in a batch, the entire batch will fail to be submitted. In short, it is in your best interests to correct all of the errors that appear in your Logs. By correcting just one error, you are potentially freeing up to 100 products.

<b>ZOOVY ERRORS/WARNINGS</b> (SKU errored before syndication)<br>
<li><b>WARN: Looks like a duplicate UPC: ?????????? for ??????????</b>Be careful with your UPCs. SKUs with the same UPC will sometimes be automatically "merged" by Amazon. ie they are assumed to be the same product, with title and images merged. This can cause your SKUs to be sold at the wrong price.<br>

<LI><B>ERROR: No Product Type for ????</B> - each product needs an Amazon Product Type declared<BR>

<LI><B>ERROR: Invalid Variation Keyword</B> - This means that you have an option associated to the Product ID that is not configured for Amazon. Options that you want sent to Amazon need to be inventorial Store Options (not Product Options) with a variation keyword selected. The variation keyword must be valid for the category used by that product.<br>

<LI><B>WARN: Image [???] is too small for ???</B> - This warning indicates that one of the images associated with this SKU is too small to be accepted by Amazon. All images submitted to Amazon must be at least 110 x 11 pixels. This is not an error, it is only a warning message. http://static.zoovy.com/img/MERCHANT/-/IMAGE<br>

<LI><B>Warning no new products to syndicate</B> - This warning indicates that there have been no changes in your Zoovy products that need to be submitted to Amazon. Amazon syndication will only run when there has been a change in products. This is not an error. It is only a warning / status message.<br>

<div>Amazon frequently adds categories to it's "restricted list", especially during the holidays.  If you believe you are permitted to sell in this restricted category, Contacting Amazon immediately is Critical.<br>
Amazon is  generally not swift to act in dealing with these issues, so the less time wasted the better.

<li><b>8008:We cannot recognize your child SKU: [???]</b> An option or related item that is assigned to this product could not be found on Seller Central.<br>
- If the SKU refers to an option, you need to figure out why the option did not syndicate.<br>
- If the SKU refers to a related item (which it most likely does,) you should either:<br>
a. Syndicate the related item to Amazon (if you want the item to remain related) and then save the parent product so that it re-syndicates.<br>

<h2>Amazon ASIN error:8004</h2>
8004: The Product with SKU [??] may be identical to existing ASINs ([?, ?, ]) based on these attributes: </B><br>

This ASIN error is usually caused when an identical or similar product exists
on Amazon.<br>
<br>

When this error occurs, you should do a search on Amazon.com
for that ASIN.	If the product that is returned is the same as the product you
are listing, you simply add that ASIN to the product and the issue should be
resolved. If that doesn't resolve the issue you will need to change the values of your product to match that of the product already on Amazon. Amazon should also have returned error message 8041 which will detail the differences between your value and the value in the Amazon catalog.<br>
<br>

If the product returned from the ASIN search is not the same as the product
you're attempting to list, then you must change something in your Amazon
product description to differentiate your product from the existing Amazon
product.<br>
<br>

If you run a search for the ASIN on Amazon.com and the return is No Match, it
indicates that the ASIN existed on Amazon at some point, but was removed, or
deleted, and the database has not yet recognized the removal. In this case contact Amazon through Seller Central.<br>
<br>

The solution here is the same as when a search returns a dissimilar product. 
You must change your Amazon product description to differentiate your product
from the one that was using that ASIN.	Add or remove manufacturer name, or
product specifics so that it is no longer considered by Amazon to be identical
to the product using that ASIN.<br>
<br>

Once the Amazon product description has been changed, the product should launch
successfully.

<b>Fatal Errors</b>
<li><b>5002</b> Amazon send fatal error messages when they simply reject a feed. We
automatically resend the feed in these circumstances but on some occasions it
requires further investigation.<br>
<br>

The 5002 error messages fall into this category. As this is an Amazon server issue there is nothing we can do to increase the number of feeds that get processed on the first attempt. It is still important to display these messages to you as they communicate that Amazon are having issues at a given time. If your feed has taken a particularly long time to process and you have received many of these messages, you know the issue is at the Amazon end.

Note: Unfortunately, not all errors are returned with the SKU in question. We
are working with Amazon to get this data.
