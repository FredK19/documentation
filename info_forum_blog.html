[[SECTION]Concept Overview]

At this time no native blog, or public forum support is included inside the Zoovy e-commerce platform. Given the evolving nature of these applications we believe it is better to integrate with existing applications. 

[[/SECTION]]

[[SECTION]Option 1: Free Hosted Applications]

Zoovy recommends the following applications:

[[BREAK]]

[[SUBSECTION]Google's Blogger.com]
[[TAG]blogger=1000]

Blogger is a free blog hosting service provided by Google.  Zoovy supports delegated DNS to this application. 

[[HINT]]
For a one time Custom-DNS $50 fee.  Zoovy can delegate DNS records for blog.domain.com to Google's blogger, thereby allowing the transfer of 1st party cookies and analytics data across domains. 
[[/HINT]]

[[CAUTION]]
At this time there is no "core" integration between Blogger and Zoovy. 
Integration may be possible for a fee, please contact sales for a quote. 
[[/CAUTION]]

Strategically placed "blog" buttons can be inserted into a wrapper by a graphic designer, this is typically not something the client would do themselves.  Usually these can be done within 1 hour of billable design time. 

[[/SUBSECTION]]

[[SUBSECTION]Ning social networking]
[[TAG]ning=1000]

Ning is a social networking service that allows users to create online forums, social sites, blogs and more. 

[[HINT]]
For a one time Custom-DNS $50 fee.  Zoovy can delegate DNS records for anything.yourdomain.com to your ning site, thereby allowing the transfer of 1st party cookies and analytics data across domains.  (NOTE: Ning has additional monthly fees which are currently $10/mo. for the ability to use your own domain!)
[[/HINT]]

[[CAUTION]]
At this time there is no "core" integration between Ning and Zoovy. 
Integration may be possible for a fee, please contact sales for a quote. 
[[/CAUTION]]
[[/SUBSECTION]]

[[HINT]]
If you have a hosted application you'd like to see on this list, please let us know. 
[[/HINT]]

[[SUBSECTION]Considerations]

BPP Clients: If you choose to have a Blog on your site, we must insist that clients provide at least two new posts every month to avoid "blog rot".  Blog rot is a neglected or abandoned blog which siphons traffic from a site and does not assist with conversions.

[[BREAK]]

Unfortunately "blog rot" is far too common among small business owners who often don't realize they have neither the time, nor the desire to maintain a blog.

[[CAUTION]]
Blogs are often viewed as "search engine gold", this is far from the truth. Blogs are highly regarded by search engines for their /fresh content/. A neglected blog has little to no value to search engine ranking, and can siphon off prospective buyers. 
[[/CAUTION]]

[[/SUBSECTION]]



[[/SECTION]]


[[SECTION]Option 2: Private Hosted Application]

Upon user request - Zoovy will delegate the domain name such as http://forum.domain.com, or http://blog.domain.com to a virtual host running on one of our DMZ servers.  On this server we will install applications such as phpbb (popular forum software), or WordPress (popular blogging software)

[[BREAK]]

More information:
<table>
<tr><td>PHPbb</td><td>http://www.phpbb.com/</td></tr>
<tr><td>WordPress</td><td>http://wordpress.org/</td></tr>
</table>

[[HINT]]
WordPress is compatible with FeedBurner.  If you use this service and are moving over to a Zoovy blog, you should use the wordpress blog service.<br>
http://www.google.com/support/feedburner/bin/topic.py?topic=13252
[[/HINT]]

[[HINT]]
You could host your blog directly through WordPress but Zoovy hosting has two big advantages:
<br>
* Zoovy Graphic Design could create a theme to match your website.
<br>
* WordPress hosted blogs have very limited plugin (seo plugin, analytics, sitemaps, etc.) options, while Zoovy hosted would allow you much bigger selection.
[[/HINT]]

[[BREAK]]

[[SUBSECTION]Hosted Application Pricing]

There is a $150 setup fee, plus $25/mo. (HOSTING bundle) 

[[HINT]]
The provisioning fee could be higher if additional customizations/module installations are requested.
[[/HINT]]

[[BREAK]]

The provisioning fee includes hosting account provisioning, application installation plus re-mediating any installation issues. 

[[BREAK]]

Any support assistance related to the application is billed as developer hours, with a 1 hour minimum.

[[/SUBSECTION]]

[[SUBSECTION]Hosted Application Support Policy]

Security in an e-commerce application is the single most important aspect of any service.
Zoovy operates these applications outside of our core network, on non-redundant servers. 

[[BREAK]]

The software being installed was not developed by Zoovy, and Zoovy has not reviewed it's source code. The software applications we recommend are widely used, and are provided free - which mean they come with no warranty, or liability. None were designed with the sole intention of being used in conjunction with an e-commerce application.

[[BREAK]]

Zoovy does not track security updates for these applications and assumes zero liability for these applications being secure.  If an application is compromised it could also compromise your website, especially if the application is hosted under the same domain.

[[BREAK]]

If Zoovy becomes aware of a security issue with an application you are using it will be upgraded and your account will be invoiced for the time. Zoovy will not seek your permission prior to executing these steps.  During a security update it may break your application, this is not Zoovy's responsibility - we may not be able to fix it as we did not write the software. 

[[BREAK]]

While we strive to provide the highest levels of service - and we believe the level of service we offer far surpasses most ISP's it is important that merchants understand the limitations of our liability.

[[/SUBSECTION]]

[[/SECTION]]




[[SECTION]Integration]

At this time no integration with the Zoovy site wrapper system, or zoovy backend - customer accounts on the 3rd party site will need to create separate forum accounts.  Zoovy will refer requests to customization of the software to a outside development firms.
