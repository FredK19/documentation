<h1>Guide to Merchant Accounts</h1>
<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>


Authors note: you don't need a merchant account to use Zoovy.

Credit cards are processed using a merchant account. 
Although you do not need to have a merchant account to do business, 
when you need one Zoovy includes support for virtually every type of merchant account you might have. 
If you don't have a merchant account yet, then Zoovy can get you running with great rates in no time. 
For more information about the current credit card processing features you should contact Zoovy customer care. 

Zoovy supports virtually every type of merchant account available, so when you're ready we'll be there. 
You can either use a linkpoint gateway or you can use an offline terminal to process credit card transactions. 
The great part is you can add credit card processing to your account anytime. 
Zoovy has excellent partnerships with some of the largest merchant banks in the country! We can help you!

<h2>Choosing a Gateway</h2>

Choosing the right gateway for your business is an important decision. 
Gateways must be compatible with your merchant account (or will be included with the merchant account). 
For assistance in selecting the right gateway you should probably contact Zoovy sales. 
Zoovy supports so many gateways, each one has advantages and disadvantages depending on the type of products you sell, 
and the transaction volume you plan on doing.
