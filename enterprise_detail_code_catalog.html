<h1>Creating a custom catalog</h1>
<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>

The Zoovy Product Manager can search a "Catalog" via HTTP. 
A catalog is nothing more than a search page which accepts fixed input parameters, and outputs a set XML format.
A catalog can be quickly and easily implemented in any web language such as Java, PHP, Perl, ASP, Python, etc.
Catalogs can implement both a "keyword" search and a "keyed" search. 
The keyed search typically uses the manufactuer UPC or ISBN, or Bookland/EAN.

<h2>Request Parameters</h2>

Two parameters are passed via a standard HTTP GET:
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>TEXT</td>
		<td>The keyword string OR keyed field</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>SEARCH</td>
		<td>The type of search being requested, the value will be one of the following: KEYWORD, SKU, or SKULIST<br>
		KEYWORD is a request for a keyword search<br>
		SKU is a request for a keyed search<br>
		SKULIST is a batch request for a comma separated list of keyed fields (not typically used)<br>
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>

NOTE: typically the most important SEARCH type to implement is the SKU, in fact you're probably safe ignoring the other two,
or simply treating all request types as a keyed search.

<h2>Output Format - SearchResponse</h2>

A search summary is generated in response to a SEARCH type of "KEYWORD" or "SKU".
The program should output an XML document, with a header type "text/xml" (note: you may need to override the default 
Content-type header returned by the server). Here is a sample of the body of the document:<br>
<aside class="html">
<h6></h6>
<code>

&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;SearchResponse&gt;
&lt;product sku="YOUR SKU" name="PRODUCT NAME" inv="INVENTORY COUNT" grp="GROUPING CODE"&gt;encoded html&lt;/product&gt;
&lt;product sku="YOUR SKU" name="PRODUCT NAME" inv="INVENTORY COUNT" grp="GROUPING CODE"&gt;encoded html&lt;/product&gt;
&lt;/SearchResponse&gt;

</code>
</aside>



The fields should be pretty self explanatory. Standard XML encoding rules apply. The HTML Description is displayed in a browser
to the user. Typically it is wise to include a brief summary so the person browsing the catalog can verify they selected the correct
product. You can include html &lt;IMG&gt; tags, and they will be displayed. The Grouping Code is another field you can use to 
represent internal data such as Genre, Supplier, you name it (this will be displayed to the user and should help them verify
they found the correct product).

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>

YOUR SKU can be any alphanumeric code, it does not necessarily need to be the keyed field that was searched on.
The value returned in "YOUR SKU" will be passed to ProductSync

</div>
</aside>



<br>


In a keyed search mode (http param SEARCH = SKU) you should only return 1 value, since a keyed field is assumed to be unique.
In a keyed search the SearchResponse will be generated first to see if the product exists, if the product fails the SKULIST request
will not be generated.

<h2>Output Format - ProductSync</h2>

A productsync request is generated after the end user has selected a product. In the case of a keyed search the client software will
automatically trigger a productsync if a match is found. 
A single HTTP parameter "PRODLIST" will be passed, just like SKULIST this is a comma separated list of products, comprised of the
values returned in the &lt;SearchResponse&gt; &lt;product&gt; tag.
Just like in SearchResponse you will need to set the header to Content-type: text/xml<br>
<br>

Here is an example response:<br>
<aside class="html">
<h6></h6>
<code>

&lt;PRODUCT TYPE="IMAGE" NAME="uniquename1a" EXT="jpg" URL="http://www.yourdomain.com/someimage1a.jpg"&gt;&lt;/PRODUCT&gt;
&lt;PRODUCT TYPE="IMAGE" NAME="uniquename2a" EXT="jpg" URL="http://www.yourdomain.com/someimage2a.jpg"&gt;&lt;/PRODUCT&gt;
&lt;PRODUCT NAME="YOUR SKU" CAT="category1/category2"&gt;
&lt;zoovy:prod_name&gt;Product Name&lt;/zoovy:prod_name&gt;
&lt;zoovy:prod_desc&gt;Product Description&lt;/zoovy:prod_desc&gt;
&lt;zoovy:prod_desc&gt;Product Description&lt;/zoovy:prod_desc&gt;
&lt;zoovy:prod_image1&gt;uniquename1a&lt;/zoovy:prod_image1&gt;
&lt;zoovy:prod_image1&gt;uniquename2a&lt;/zoovy:prod_image1&gt;
&lt;zoovy:....&gt;other fields&lt;/zoovy:....&gt;
&lt;/PRODUCT&gt;
&lt;PRODUCT TYPE="IMAGE" NAME="uniquename1b" EXT="jpg" URL="http://www.yourdomain.com/someimage1b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/PRODUCT&gt;
&lt;PRODUCT TYPE="IMAGE" NAME="uniquename2b" EXT="jpg" URL="http://www.yourdomain.com/someimage2b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/PRODUCT&gt;
&lt;PRODUCT NAME="YOUR SKU" CAT="category1/category2"&gt;
&lt;zoovy:prod_name&gt;Product Name&lt;/zoovy:prod_name&gt;
&lt;zoovy:prod_desc&gt;Product Description&lt;/zoovy:prod_desc&gt;
&lt;zoovy:prod_image1&gt;uniquename1b&lt;/zoovy:prod_image1&gt;
&lt;zoovy:prod_image1&gt;uniquename2b&lt;/zoovy:prod_image1&gt;
&lt;zoovy:....&gt;other fields&lt;/zoovy:....&gt;
&lt;/PRODUCT&gt;

You can set every possible field in the product, there are literally over 10,000 possible fields you can set 
(when you figure in all the eBay fields, Amazon fields, Shopping.com fields, Yahoo Shopping Fields, Froogle Fields, etc.) you will 
work with your enterprise account manager to come up with the list of data you have available, along with 
the formatting requirements. You can also create your own custom fields. In addition Zoovy has a sophisticated mapping system
that allows various marketplaces to share data (this reduces the amount of storage needed and also makes it easier for the 
user to update). Again, this is all handled on Zoovy's end - let your account manager know which fields are available and they'll
come up with a list of mappings.<br>
<br>
The PRODUCT TYPE=IMAGE are special nodes that trigger the client to download and import the image. The url you are 
referencing should ALWAYS be the highest quality copy you've got. Zoovy will automatically download the image
and dynamically resize it (while maintaining aspect ratio) and re-compress the image to the page layout it is
being fit in. The system can import GIF, JPG, PNG, PSD, TIFF, BMP, and a variety of other formats.
The unique name for the image is called the "Collection Name" and must be unique system wide, if two products
share an image they can have the same collection name. The first product image will also be used as the
thumbnail unless zoovy:prod_thumb is set.
