<h1>Flows - CART Element</h1>
<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>

This guide discusses the "CART" element - specifically the ability to embed server side javascript into the cart
element to create your a customized cart presentation.<br>

This document is written for Zoovy employees who are building
customized carts for customers, and contains references to specific Zoovy internal policies and procedures.
Customers do not necessarily need to follow these "guidelines" - with the exception of the performance guidelines.
Failure to adhere to the performance guidelines could result in the cart being deactivated and replaced with a
default Zoovy cart. <br>

<b>Effective 9/18/04: Consultants/Independent Contractors who are building projects for customers *MUST* adhere to all guidelines to 
ensure forward compatibility. Keep reading to learn why:</b><br>
<br>
Failure to provide full compatibility for all Zoovy features will most likely result in a disruption of
the customers business, which will ultimately result in a monetary loss. When a monetary loss occurs
customers have been known to drag these issues into court. Therefore it is paramount Individuals/Consultants building 
applications be aware of the following:<br>
<br>

<li> Projects which fail to adhere to the current compatibility guidelines at the time of delivery are 
considered "incomplete" and therefore would be deemed NOT fit for use by the platform vendor (Zoovy). 
This statement entitles a customer to receive refunds, and possibly take punitive actions against a 
consultant for stating otherwise. Zoovy recommends Consultant/Individuals provide a customer with a copy of these
guidelines and an affidavit stating they are compliant upon project delivery. We recommend customers "sign off" that either
they, or another consultant, or the Zoovy development staff has reviewed the code for compatibility prior to accepting
the project.<br>
<Br>

<li> Companies/Individuals who fail to adhere to the published guidelines fully indemnify Zoovy, and therefore assume full 
responsibility for any disruptions to the customers business. This statement should be considered and amendment to the Zoovy Terms 
of service, and Acceptable Use Policy - by using our platform this supercedes ANY previous contract you had with 
your customer that may limit your responsibility.<br>
<br>

<li> Therefore as viewed by a court of law, a customer should be entitled to a full refund on any fees paid to any
Individual/Consultant, as well as damages (within on jurisdictional guidelines) from Individuals/Companies who do not 
adhere to these guidelines. <br>
<br>

<li> Reliability is a key feature of our platform and our brand - outages adversely affect our brand. 
Therefore if an Individual/Company chooses not to adhere to these guidelines, Zoovy may independently determine it is 
appropriate to take legal action against them. Zoovy reserves the right to pursue legal remedies as allowed by a court of law including, 
but not limited to: court  ordered cessitation of all services to all Zoovy customers, and/or financial remedies as afforded by trademark laws. 
The venue and laws governing any such action will be determined by California, district of San Diego.<br>
<br>
<li> Adherence to these guidelines does not guarantee compatibility, or proper operation - and under no circumstances
does Zoovy warranty, or assume any responsibility for 3rd party code. Zoovy certifies that any code delivered to our 
customers and certified ready for use meets these guidelines.

<p>
By default if you specify type of "CART" with VERSION=1 and a CODE segment you will get
buttons regardless of that setting - this is simply to preserve forward compatibility.
Because of the amount of logic that is actually implemented in a javascript cart.

Performance:
	1. calling CART.count() rather than setting a variable equal to stuff count and decrementing the variable.
	2. fetching the same key/value from an external function/object more than 3 times in the operation of a 
	   program (instead copy it to a variable in the local memory rather than calling out to an external function)
	   
Compatibility:
	1. Failure to encode STIDS when passing on a URI (remember STIDS contain #) 
	2. Failure to display / handle simple promotions.
	3. Failure to display possible shipping modes (waivers available in certain instances where it is not possible)

Forward compatibility:
	1. Attempting to parse STIDS from STUFF object.
	2. Poor commenting - chances are somebody (probably me) is going to have to look at this in the future - failure
	   to comment will result in possible loss of authorship priviledges and/or termination. 
	3. Failure to adhere to current coding style guidelines. 
			
	   
The following zoovy functions are automatically imported into the javascript namespace:

themeini(key) - returns a text string of a value in the theme.ini file
webdb(key) - returns a text string of a value in the webdb
flow_url(pagetype) - returns the appropriate URI to a specific page type.
element(key) - returns values which are stored inside the <ELEMENT> tag [ex: element('SHOW_CART') returns a 0/1]
moneyformat(value) - returns a properly formatted dollar value - use this function to format all money values to
		- help ensure forward compatibility with multi-currency.


The following zoovy objects are automatically imported into the javascript namespace:
[in order to use these you must declare them .. ex: var cart = new CART;]

#################################
STUFF - stuff is a container object for products, it is used in both carts, and orders. Because stuff is a very
complex format, only a limited number of stuff properties are brought into javascript although we may add more
over time.

## STUFF.as_xml() - returns the product contents as xml.
    note: this is serialized using the same internal function an order uses. This is *incredibly* handy for peering
    inside a particular cart to see what data is kept in there - also for data interchange. 

## STUFF.itemList() - returns a list of stids separated by pipes.
    returns a list of STIDs (stuff id's) separated by | (pipe) characters. A STID is a unique object in a cart.
    you should not attempt to break down the stid - as it's format may change over time, it simply guaranteed not to
    contain a pipe symbol, and it is guaranteed to be unique in the cart. If you want the SKU or the PRODUCT then use
    the "item" method.
    
## STUFF.item(STID,PROPERTY)
    fetches a property of a specific stid. 


#################################
CART - in reality the STUFF object is stored inside the CART, so when you view the CART object you'll see the "STUFF"
    inside it. -- it is important to realize that you cannot access the STUFF contents except through the STUFF object.
    
## CART.count() - returns the number of items in the cart.
	- you should only call this once per cart, and set a variable to the value rather than calling .count() for
	each interation of a loop. This is much faster, and reduces system load.
