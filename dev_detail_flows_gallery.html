<h1>Gallery Page Layout</h1>
<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>

Galleries are used to display a list of channels which are currently running, 
or will soon be running on a marketplace. The gallery page by default is located at
http://yourname.zoovy.com/gallery.cgis however any of the elements below may be used on any page (including the homepage or any category).
<br>
<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>

<h2>GALLERY</h2>

<aside class="html">
<h6></h6>
<code>

&lt;ELEMENT TYPE="GALLERY" NAME="GALLERY1"&gt;
SAVETO=page:gallery
LIMIT=#
&lt;/ELEMENT&gt;

</code>
</aside>



LIMIT is the maximum number of listings which will appear in the gallery. The maximum number is 500

<h2>GALLERYSELECT</h2>

<aside class="html">
<h6></h6>
<code>

&lt;ELEMENT TYPE="GALLERYSELECT" NAME="GALLERYSELECT1"&gt;
SAVETO=page:gallery
&lt;/ELEMENT&gt;

</code>
</aside>



The GALLERYSELECT element displays a tabbed list of marketplaces which have one or more listings, along with the number of listings.
The colors and fonts are based on the wrapper which is selected.

<h2>PRODGALLERY</h2>

The PRODGALLERY is a stand in replacement for the product list. 
It can be used in any of the following contexts:<br>
<li> A product page - it displays a list of channels (in a list format) which are currently active for the product selected.
<li> A category page - it displays a list of channels which are related to any products associated with the page (NOTE: You do not necessarily need to have a PRODLIST element on the same page - the list of products is pulled from the navigation category)
<li> Any page - displays a full list of active channels, similar to the GALLERY element, but it allows customization.

<aside class="html">
<h6></h6>
<code>

&lt;ELEMENT TYPE="PRODGALLERY" NAME="PRODGALLERY1"&gt;
BLANKMESSAGE=html message which is displayed if no items are available.
PG= the safename of the category to pull products from (this overrides the current category/product in focus)
SAVETO=page:gallery
FORMAT=THUMB|PLAIN|CUSTOM 
COLS=3 (number of columns)
ALTERNATE=1/0 (alternate row colors)
HTML=the list specification for FORMAT CUSTOM (refer to PRODLIST documentation)
&lt;/ELEMENT&gt;

</code>
</aside>


<br>
<br>
The following custom variables are available for each item in a PRODLIST element (in addition to all product attributes)<br>
<table>
<tr>
	<td>gallery:channel</td>
	<td>The channel associated with the current item</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>gallery:starts</td>
	<td>The unixtimestamp when the listing begins (this assumes that a scheduler has been set for the item)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>gallery:countdown</td>
	<td>The pretty "starts in" time</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>gallery:launchtime</td>
	<td>The pretty time and date the listing starts</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>gallery:ends</td>
	<td>The unixtimestamp when the listing will end</td>

</tr>
<tr>
	<td>gallery:bidprice</td>
	<td>The current bid price (or the fixed price for fixed price only listings)</td>

</table>
In addition to the variables above, you may reference any product variables. 
However if you do not reference any product variables then the listing will be rendered substantially faster (since the product lookup will not occur).

<h2>So, what can I do with this stuff?</h2>

<a name="whatnow"></a>
The PRODGALLERY element allows you to create websites that would be impossible without the Zoovy content management engine.
<br>
Here are a few examples of neat stuff we've done in the past:<br>
<br>
<section>
<h3>One of a Kind Seller w/Website Model</h3>

<b>The basic idea:</b>
Sell on the store First, items that do no sell go to eBay later (but are still listed on store).<br>
<br>
<b>How to do it:</b>
Configure inventory so it does not allow items which are reserved to be purchased.
First create products for each item and place them on the website. (HINT: use an incrementing SKU e.g. 
1,2,3..999 to keep track of an items age relative to other items on the site). 
Periodically go through the database and find items which are old and have not been sold and create channels for them 
(e.g. powerlisters, which continue until sold). 
Use the PRODGALLERY on the product page layout to direct buyers who arrive at the product to bid on the item at eBay.
(Hint: using a custom auction definition you could change the product flow automatically when you create a listing).

<section>
<h3>One of a Kind Seller w/Website Showcase</h3>

<b>The basic idea:</b>
List items on the storefront, along with the time the item will start. 
Since eBay auction times are typically very short this gives you an excellent way to showcase popular items BEFORE
the auction starts and also provide a permanent landing page for items which can be used on promotional materials. 
Ideally this could be used with a custom hosted script which allowed people to register for notifications when items
would start e.g. a button which says "Tell me when the auction starts".<br>
<br>
<b>How to do it: </b>
Do not specify a retail price on items (this will prevent them from being purchased via the website).
Use a product layout which includes the PRODGALLERY, immediately create the channels for each item and use channel 
scheduler to specify a start time in the future, use the scheduler feature "Add this item to the channel list immediately".
To generate the "Tell me when this auction starts" 
use a custom list format which passes the product id, and starting time for a listing to a remote CGI which is loaded in popup.
<br>
<b>Other Ideas: Buy It BEFORE the Auction starts</b> -
Especially useful for items where the retail value is predictable and high (so you don't have to pay marketplace fees) - e.g.
cars, boats, houses. Simply set the retail price to the price you want, enable inventory on the item then create a scheduler 
in the future which verifies inventory before launch. If the item is already sold, it will NOT launch.

<section>
<h3>Amazon.com model (new and used next to eachother)</h3>

<b>The basic idea:</b>
Selling returns, and slightly damaged goods next to your own items becomes a snap. 
Use your favorite auction site like eBay.com (or any Zoovy compatible marketplace for that matter) to let buyers to your website 
choose to bid or buy an item. <br>
<br>
<b>How to do it:</b>
Simply create a custom page flow which has a PRODGALLERY element on it. 
When you launch a listing, just make sure the custom page flow is selected and thats it.
You might also want to configure the BLANKMESSAGE portion of the element to display a message when there are no listings currently running.

Please note: at this time there are no default system flows which include the PRODGALLERY element. 
Because of their highly specialized nature they are built into custom flows and are only available to accounts with the WEB bundle.
