Zoovy is no longer supporting ControlScan services for our clients.  We discontinued our relationship with ControlScan after a dispute regarding sales practices and have been referring our clients to McAfee exclusively since then.

[[SECTION]Control Scan: ProvideSupport]

Zoovy is currently working with Provide Support (www.providesupport.com) to develop a live chat CRM plugin for our clients.  Clients who purchase the Provide Support service via Control Scan will not be eligible to have that integration as it will only be enabled under Zoovy's master license number.
