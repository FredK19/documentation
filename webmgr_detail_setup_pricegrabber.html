Zoovy does not send up inventory numbers, only a "yes" or "no" for availability.  for this reason items will go up to pricegrabber either way.  Products are only removed from pricegrabber is inventory is set to "0".

PriceGrabber.com is one of the leading online comparison shopping marketplaces.
PriceGrabber has two business models:
<li> CPC - Cost per click (you pay for each click generated to your website).
<li> Storefront -  they charge a final value fee similar to Half.com when an item sells. (At this point, only CPCs are supported.)

[[SECTION]Getting Started]


[[CAUTION]]Please note: AT THIS TIME ONLY CPC ACCOUNTS ARE SUPPORTED.<br><br>
It is very hard to control your spend with Pricegrabber, especially during any busy holiday seasons ex. halloween, christmas.  Even with budgeting in place, you will still see overages because it takes between 3-4 days for listings to be removed completely from their affliates.  We recommended: 
<li> setting a monthly budget (must be on auto-pay, then will appear under Rates& Payments >> Payment Center)
<li> using the bidding tools to reduce cpc rates on specific products or categories (must opt in to this tool (Rates& Payments >> Bidding Tool)
<li> limiting products sent (don't send product with lower margins, you decide what the margin is for you)
[[/CAUTION]]

<br>
You are welcome to signup for a storefront account, however Pricegrabber has not finished their integration and at this time they are NOT able to transmit the orders back to zoovy.<br>
<Br>

[[HINT]]

NOTE: CPC Customers must sign the Pricegrabber marketing agreement to get their products listed.

[[SECTION]Usage Notes]


<li> PriceGrabber needs manufacturer part number, and manufacturer name in order to add products to it's site.
If this information is not available (or present in the product), then the product may not be sold on PriceGrabber.
<li> In addition to the manufacturer information, you also need to set the product to syndicate to the PriceGrabber marketplace, and have a PriceGrabber category set for the product. To turn syndication "on" for the product, check the box under "Marketplace Syndication labeled PriceGrabber.  To set the category at the product level, click on the box labeled "Enter Specifics".  If you want to match your product categories to those of PriceGrabber, you can do this more globally under Syndication > PriceGrabber > Categories.
<li> Zoovy automatically submits a feed to PriceGrabber every 24 hours that contains all of the products and quantities available for sale.

[[/SECTION]]



[[SECTION]CPC Notes]

In a cost per click model, customers are sent by PriceGrabber back to your Zoovy store. 
There is nothing you need to do. 

[[/SECTION]]


[[SECTION]Troubleshooting Feeds]
<li>
If you are using Pricegrabber for multiple Specialty sites you will need separate profiles for each site. Also you will need to setup separate Pricegrabber accounts for each profile. This will help keep your different types of products going up to the right location in Pricegrabber.</li><br>

<li>If you are not seeing any products going up to Pricegrabber and you are getting successful syndication from Zoovy, look to make sure you have categories mapped to that specific profile. To check to see which categories are mapped go to "Syndication" then click on "Pricegrabber" then click "edit" the profile in question. Once there click on "Categories" and you will be able to see if anything is mapped to that profile. 
</li>

<li>If you are still not seeing any results after a successful syndication from Zoovy, you will need to send an email to merchantservices@pricegrabber.com.  Give your username and password, how you're sending the data feed (FTP), how they can get in contact with you.  Please ask them to give you a call back with a phone number you can be reached at.</li>
