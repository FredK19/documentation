<h1>Cardservice Gateway Configuration</h1>
<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>

This document deals specifically with Linkpoint. For more general information about gateways please visit:
<a class="linkdoc" href="#?doc=50611">Doc 50611</a>


Linkpoint gateway is a service by Cardservice that allows you to conduct real-time credit card and 
automatic check processing services over the Internet. Zoovy supports the linkpoint API from Cardservice, 
in addition to several other gateways which are compatible with other processors.<br>
<Br>
Zoovy supports both AVS (Address Verification System) and CVV (Card Verification Value) via the Cardservice Linkpoint gateway.

<h2>CVV/AVS Codes</h2>

In the order events you will find an auth code it will appear as a string of numbers and letters separated by colons e.g. 12354:ABCD:5789:.
The second 4 digit alphanumeric code represents that AVS transaction.<br>
<br>
The first 3 digits indicate AVS code:
<li> YY* Address matches, zip code matches
<li> YN* Address matches, zip code does not match
<li> YX* Address matches, zip code comparison not available
<li> NY* Address does not match, zip code matches
<li> XY* Address comparison not available, zip code matches
<li> NN* Address comparison does not match, zip code does not match
<li> NX* Address does not match, zip code comparison not available
<li> XN* Address comparison not available, zip code does not match
<li> XX* Address comparisons not available, zip code comparison not available
<li> (*) -- This is the one character response code sent by the authorizing bank and it varies by card type (e.g., Y,Z,A,N,U,R,S,E,G are valid responses for Visa.;
 Y,Z,A,N,X,W,U,R,S are valid for MasterCard.; Y,Z,A,N,U,R,S are valid for American Express. and A,Z,Y,N,W,U are valid for Discover.).
<br>
If Full AVS validation is required then anything besides a YY, YX, XY, and XX is treated as a failure.<br>
If Partial AVS validation is required then only an NN will be treated as a failure.<br>
<br>
The last digit incidates CVV code:<br>
<li> M Card Code Match
<li> N Card code does not match
<li> P Not processed
<li> S Merchant has indicated that the card code is not present on the card
<li> U Issuer is not certified and/or has not provided encryption keys
<li> A blank response should indicate that no code was sent and that there was no indication that the code was not present on the card.
<br>
If CVV indicator is present then an N will result in a failure. (All other codes indicate the CVV could not be processed).
<br>

<h2>Handling CVV/AVS failures</h2>

The cardservice gateway does not support the ability to reject authorization if AVS or CVV values fail. (This is currently only supported
by Authorize.Net). For this reason if you receive a failure you should go an void the transaction via linkpoint.com.

<h2>Cardservice Configuration on Zoovy</h2>

Cardservice will provide you with a file (usually referred to as a "PEM" file) which needs to be linked to your account.  If Web Manager is telling you that there is a configuration error,
open a support ticket at http://support.zoovy.com, attach the PEM file to the ticket and we will install the file for you.
