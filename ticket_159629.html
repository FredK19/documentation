This does not provide the sufficient level of detail to do a threat analysis.
I know there are cases where scan alert reports a false positive.
Please attach the full report to this ticket.

Overview 
    
Name WebApp Cross Site Scripting  
Category HTTP - Web Application Severity  Medium       High In PCI 
Impact Cross Site Scripting (XSS)  Fix Difficulty  Medium    
 
Description 
The remote web application appears to be vulnerable to cross site scripting (XSS). 

The cross-site scripting attack is one of the most common, yet overlooked, security problems facing web developers today. A web site is vulnerable if it displays user-submitted content without checking for malicious script tags.

The target of cross-site scripting attacks is not the server itself, but the user files on the server, such as forms and other dynamic content. All a malicious attacker needs to do is find a page that does not properly sanitize user input, but returns the scripting code verbatim to the browser of a visitor to that website. It is important to note that websites that use SSL are just as vulnerable as websites that do not encrypt browser sessions. 

The damage caused by such an attack can range from stealing session and cookie data from your customers to loading a virus payload onto their computer via browser. 

The pages listed in the vulnerability output will display embedded javascript with no filtering back to the user. 
 
General Solution 
Ensure you turn the > and < into their HTML encoded equivalents before sending it back to the browser. 

Ensure that parameters and user input are stripped of HTML tags before using.

Remove <: input = replace( input, "<", "" ) 
Remove >: input = replace( input, ">", "" ) 
Remove ' : input = replace( input, "'", "" ) 
Filtering < and > alone will not solve all cross site scripting attacks and it is suggested you also attempt to filter out ( and ) by translating them to their encoded equivalents as well.
----------

I think maybe it was a false positive - a set it to rescan and now there are no vulnerabilities found.

I think their tool has bugs. :-)

I assure you, on behalf of all developers here -- we are *acutely* aware of XSS possibilities, those mistakes are made by amateurs.

In the future if you can get me a URL along with what was transmitted we can investigate further.
