<h2>Issue #160137: eBay Incomplete items not being created</h2>

We are having issues with eBay items selling and Zoovy not creating incomplete item orders. 

</article>

<article>
<h2>Tech Response</h2>

In troubleshooting this issue, I discovered that your ebay authorization token is invalid.  I don't know if your token expired, was cancelled, or removed from your eBay account but before I can troubleshoot this issue further, I'll need you to refresh your token.

<br>

This may well resolve the entire issue.

If it does not, please update this ticket once you have refreshed your token.

<h2>Custom Question</h2>
Authorization tokens expire?? It was not cancelled nor revoked. How do I refresh it? 

</article>

<article>
<h2>Resolution</h2>
I refreshed the authorization token by going to Manage | eBay | and selecting the "Accounts" tab, however the ebay items are still not showing in the incomplete file on Zoovy.

<h2>Resolution</h2>
The authorization token expires once per year.
In addition, changing your ebay password or username can also cause it.

<br>

The listings won't create incomplete items immediately (automatically), you would need to click the "instant checkout" link in each one.

<br>

However the backup eBay polling system should catch anything which ended in the last week .. it could take a couple of hours.

In this case the backup polling system took about 15 minutes from the time the authorization token was refreshed.
