<h1>Accepting Donations</h1>
<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>




Donations are a bit tricky, but can absolutely be done.

Zoovy normally requires that each item in a store have a set price, the only way to circumvent this is to use a soft cart setting that is a Developer option. If you do not have developer on your account then you cannot allow customers to configure the amount, however this should not stop you - just create donation products in the most common donation amounts ($5, $10, $25, $50, $100, $250, $500, $1000, etc.)  Name each of the products with a unique identifier.  For example, start each one with the letters DON and then verify that no products in your store also start with DON. 

Make sure the DON series of products are not taxable.

You should also make sure the products have a product id that separates them from the other products in your store (e.g. DON*). 
Then create a simple shipping method for zero dollars, name it Donation  no shipping. 
Then configure a rule so that if the cart contains only DON* then rule processing is stopped. 
Then configure a second rule that disables the shipping method (this will have the effect of 
ensuring that free shipping is not available when a customer purchases a donation and another item.)

<h2>Custom Amounts</h2>

Using custom HTML and a modified buy me button (with a variable price) you can allow a customer to enter a custom amount.

<h2>Special considerations</h2>


If you normally use simple shipping in your store then please note that donation items 
will count as items in the cart, and will increase the shipping price. To counter-act this 
effect you should reduce the price for each discount item using shipping rules.

NOTE: using promotion rules you can also automatically add free gifts to the customers cart when donations of a certain amount are purchased.
