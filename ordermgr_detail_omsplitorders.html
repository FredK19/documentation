<h1>Splitting Orders</h1>
<article>
<h2>Why Split Orders</h2>

Order splitting lets you take a single order, and split it in to two separate orders, 
which is a feature most commonly used for breaking apart invoices if certain items are not 
in stock so you can easily fulfill partial orders.

<h2>Usage:</h2>

Check the boxes next to the items you wish to move to the new order, then choose the appropriate method of handling shipping, and order date. When you are done click the "Split Order" button on the upper toolbar and the Order Manager will go to the website and allocate a new order id, as well as recompute shipping for one or both orders if needed. After clicking the Split Order button you will be taken to a review screen where you can make changes before saving both new orders.

<h2>Shipping Handling:</h2>

you have three choices when it comes to handle to handle shipping on a split order.
No shipping on new order - this will leave the shipping on the original order the same, and will set the shipping on the future order to zero. This is the most typical scenario where you want to fulfill a portion of the order and not penalize the customer with extra shipping.
Recalculate shipping on both orders - as you might expect this will recompute the shipping according to your policies and lets you review the changes on the review screen. You will still have the opportunity to input a custom shipping price for both orders.
Calculate shipping on new order - this will leave the shipping on the original order intact and will only compute shipping for the new order.

<h6></h6>
<div> In Order Manager version 6 or higher we have slightly changed how you splint and combine orders. This small change is that you can no longer split or combine orders while they are in the Recent tab.  You can  split and combine orders from any other tab

<h2>Date Handling:</h2>

Same date as original order: this will make it appear as if the customer placed two orders on the same date. If you are reserving backorder quantities this option will give you the most accurate picture assuming you have a first come first serve backorder policy.
Todays date on new order: This will leave the old order intact, and put the current date on the new order.

The split order email is generated by Zoovy Order Manager for windows when an order is split. 
It contains the new invoice number, as well as the old invoice number and which products appear on which invoice.
