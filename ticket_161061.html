<h2>Issue #161061: Sales tax not added to order</h2>

Order# ORDER 2007-11-1234 the sales tax is not added to it in zoovy but the sales tax was charged to the buyer. I know that because I can see it in google checkout . The buyer has paid sales tax but its not reflected in the order.

<h2>Resolution</h2>
The product that was purchased is not flagged as taxable in Zoovy.

Google does not have "services" so it (incorrectly) assumes that everything is taxable.

<aside class="hint">
<h6></h6>
<div>
You can easily enable taxable on all your products using the product powertool by setting the "zoovy:taxable" field to "1".

This is something that support can assist you with if you'd like.
