<h1>Advanced Guide - Navigation Categories and Lists</h1>
<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>

You can create nested categories up to four levels deep, you can also group products by common properties such as 
manufacturer, size, color or the juiciness score. 
Pretty much whatever you want to do, you're going to be able to do it. 
You can even control the exact order that products are displayed in each category.

Most people will not purchase from your website if it takes more than three or four clicks to actually add the product to the shopping cart.
If you have many nested sub-categories, you should enable a page layout for the category that allows the customer to add the product to the shopping
cart from the category page.

<h2>Hidden Categories</h2>

Product categories let you organize your products into a hierarchy on your website. 
You can also create "hidden categories" by putting a exclaimation mark (!) as the first letter of the category name.

<h2>Order Navigation Categories</h2>

It is true website categories are created in alphabetical order. However, 
they keep their order and related url when renamed. For instance, if you 
create three categories 0-2, they will be displayed on the website 0, then 1, 
then 2. At this point you can rename 0 to be Dog, 1 to be Zebra and 2 to be 
Armadillo. The Categories will still be displayed in their original order.

<h2>Lists</h2>

A list is nothing more than a root level, category that does not appear as a category.
Lists can have be mapped for syndication, and most importantly Lists can also be used as the source for a product list.
Lists are most commonly used by developers when creating custom themes and page layouts.
In addition Zoovy has programs that automatically update lists with products (e.g. best sellers, or most frequently searched products)
