<h3>Recent News</h3>
The first thing you see when you log into your Zoovy account is Recent News. This is updated regularly, sometimes several times a day. Keep your eye on the Recent News for updates, new releases and status messages. You can get to the Recent News from any place in your Zoovy account by clicking on the Zoovy logo in the upper left corner.

<h3>Support Tickets</h3>
A Support ticket opens an issue to be handled by our Support or Development staff. Tech Support always needs you to provide examples and details of your issue to better assist you. There is no such thing as "too much information" in a Support ticket. Most delays in Support occur because a ticket does not include enough information. Avoid "how do I..." questions in support - you will likely be referred to implementation/training.

<h3>Implementation</h3>
Training is where you get answers to "how-to" questions. In the first few weeks, all new customers should schedule a series of training sessions, allowing time between sessions to apply what has been learned.
<aside class="cbc">
<h6>A Recommended Training Calendar Structure</h6>
<div>
<li> First training: The first training session should be at least 30 minutes. 45 minutes or 55 minutes is ideal.
<li> Second training: Schedule another follow-up training session within a few days of the first. This should be roughly about the same time length as the first.
<li> Third Training and Beyond: Everyone is different. By the end of the second training session, the customer and trainer should have some idea of how to proceed, and recommendations will be made.

<h3>Web Docs</h3>
The Web Docs serve as the instructional manual for Zoovy. Please note the HELP link in the upper right of your Zoovy account. When you click on the HELP link you will either be taken to a page with relevant material about the page that you are currently viewing or to a search box.<br>
When you type a phrase or question in the Web Doc search, two kinds of results come up. FAQS are frequently asked questions with short answers. The link below the answer will take you to a page with further details. Below the FAQ's are Documents matching the phrase that you were searching. These are usually more lengthy and detailed instructions.<br>
Further, once you click on a document folders to the left will allow you to browse the Web Docs. This can often be useful if a text search gets you close to the subject that you are researching but not the exact answer that you want.

<aside class="hint">

<div> When asking a question in the Web Docs be certain to end it with a question mark (?) for best results.

<h2>Homework</h2>Before you move on ensure that you have scheduled a training appointment for a future date. You probably want at least a 30 minute session, usually longer. This is time for questions that arise during setup, a double-check for the work that you have accomplished and a chance to look at other features in Zoovy that you may not have considered.
